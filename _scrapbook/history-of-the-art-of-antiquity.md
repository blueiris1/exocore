# History of the Art of Antiquity

(Note-to-self: there are some remaining materials to gather here)

In Winckelmann’s mind, Hellenic sculpture represented not so much an art as a religion and appreciation of its “noble simplicity” and “quiet grandeur” demanded not a descriptive narrative but a full-blown aesthetic theory with borders pushed to the extreme heights of neo-Platonic idealism. Greek art and history became cult through his words, and even though the soiled Elgin Marbles were still perched atop the pitted columns of the Parthenon, as yet hardly seen by European eyes, Winckelmann wrote their history — perhaps the history of all art histories. The history of art should inform us about the origin, growth, change, and fall of art, together with the various styles of peoples, periods, and artists, and should demonstrate this as far as possible by reference to the remaining works of antiquity.

### Reasons for the Diversity of Art Amongst Different Peoples

The Greeks — who lived in a moderate climate and under a moderate government and inhabited a land that Pallas, it is said, allotted to them for habitation above all other lands because of its moderate seasons — had concepts and images as painterly as their language. Their poets, from Homer on, not only speak through images but also produce and paint images that often consist of a single word distinguished by its sound and sketched, as it were, in living color. Their imagination was not exaggerated, as with the Eastern and southern peoples, and their senses, which acted through quick and sensitive nerves on a fine-woven brain, discovered instantly the various characteristics of a subject and concerned themselves chiefly with reflecting on that subject’s beauty.

In Athens, however, where after the expulsion of the tyrants, a democratic form of government was adopted in which the whole people participated, the spirit of every citizen soared and the city rose above all the Greeks. As good taste was now widespread, and as wealthy citizens sought by means of splendid public buildings and works of art to inspire the respect and love of their fellow citizens and to pave the way to honor, everything flowed into this city, with its power and greatness, like rivers into the sea.

### Art of the Egyptians

Among the reasons for the peculiarities of Egyptian art, the first has to do with the appearance of the Egyptian people, which did not have that excellence needed to inspire the artist to ideas of high beauty. With regard to the Egyptian temperament and way of thinking, they were a people who appear not to have been inclined toward gaiety and pleasure. For music — on behalf of which the earliest Greeks sought to make even their laws more amenable and in which contests were held even before the time of Homer — was not practiced in Egypt. Because of this temperament, the Egyptians sought to rouse their imagination and animate their spirit through violent means. The melancholy of this nation thus produced the first hermits, and a modern writer claims to have found somewhere that at the end of the fourth century there were more than seventy thousand monks in Lower Egypt alone. The Egyptians wished to be kept under strict laws and absolutely could not live without a king, which perhaps is the reason why Egypt was termed “bitter Egypt” by Homer. Their thinking exceeded the natural, and they were preoccupied with the mysterious. In addition, there is the antipathy of this people toward all foreign customs, and those of the Greeks in particular, especially before the Egyptians were subject to Greek rule. This antipathy must have made their artists indifferent toward the art of other peoples, a feeling that hindered the course of both science and art. Finally, one of the reasons for the nature of Egyptian art noted here lay in the estimation of and technical knowledge possessed by their artists: they were regarded as artisans and ranked in the lowest class.

With regard to the technical knowledge Egyptian artists had, they must have lacked one of the most important aspects of art, namely, an understanding of anatomy — a science that, in Egypt as in China, was not practiced at all or even recognized as such. From their stylistic distinction between figures and animals, we may conclude that the former represented deities or holy persons whose appearance had universally been established, whereas the artist was allowed greater freedom in depicting animals. With regard to figures, one might imagine the system of ancient art in Egypt as similar to the system of government in Crete or Sparta, where one was not allowed to deviate by as much as a finger’s breadth from the ancient ordinances of their lawgivers; animals would not have been subsumed under this rational framework. The Egyptians had no knowledge of the soft profile of Greek heads. Instead, the bridge of the nose is the same as in vulgar nature; the cheekbones are strongly indicated and raised; the chin is always small, and the oval of the face is thus imperfect. The cut of the mouth or the line between the lips — which in nature, or at least in Greeks and Europeans, is pulled slightly downward at the corners of the mouth — is there drawn upward on Egyptian heads.

The history of the art of the Egyptians is, as is their land, like a large desolate plain that can be fully surveyed from two or three high towers. The entire range of ancient Egyptian art has two periods, and from both beautiful pieces survive, on the basis of which we can evaluate the art of their time. It stands in contrast to the art of the Greeks and Etruscans: mirroring their lands, which are mountainous, it is therefore unable to be surveyed. And thus I believe that the present discussion has shed the requisite light on Egyptian art.

Regarding the art of these southern and Eastern peoples taken together, a few general observations may now be appended. If we consider the monarchical form of government in Egypt as well as among the Phoenicians and Persians, in which the absolute ruler shared the highest honors with none of the people, we can imagine that statues were not bestowed on any other person in recompense for his service to his native land, as is the case in free states, ancient as well as modern. There is, moreover, no report of this recognition being bestowed on a subject of these kingdoms. Carthage, indeed, was a free state in Phoenicia and was governed by its own laws, but the mutual jealousy of its two powerful parties would have made giving the honor of immortality to any one citizen contentious. A general stood in danger of paying for each mistake with his head; history makes no mention of great testimonials of honor among these people. As a result, art existed among these peoples mostly for religious ends and could derive little profit and growth from civic life. Artistic concepts were therefore far more limited there than among the Greeks, and their artistic spirit was bound to accepted forms by superstition.

### Art of the Greeks

The influence of climate must invigorate the seed from which art is to germinate, and Greece was the preferred soil for this seed; the flair for philosophy that Epicurus wanted to attribute solely to the Greeks could with greater justification have been claimed for art. Much that we might imagine as ideal was natural for them. Where Nature is less enveloped in clouds and heavy vapors, she gives the body a riper form earlier; she expresses herself in powerful, particularly female creations, and in Greece she will have perfected its people to the finest degree. The Greeks were conscious of this and of, as Polybius says, their own superiority to other peoples generally; and among no other people was beauty so highly esteemed as by them. For this reason, nothing was concealed that could enhance it, and the artists beheld beauty face-to-face every day. Beauty was even in the service, as it were, of fame, and we find the most beautiful beings recorded in Greek histories; certain individuals were denominated with an epithet for a single beautiful part of their appearance, as Demetrios Phalereus was for his beautiful eyebrows. Thus, beauty contests were already being organized in the earliest times by Kypselos, king of Arcadia at the time of the Herakleidai, near the Alpheus river, in the region of Elis. At the festival of Apollo Philesios, a prize was bestowed for the most learned kiss among the young people. It was decided by a judge, as was probably also the contest held in Megara, at the tomb of Diodes. In Sparta, and on Lesbos, at the Temple of Juno, and among the Parrhasians, beauty contests were held among the women. 

In very early times, art was already used to preserve the memory of a person by erecting his statue, and this means was available to every Greek. Given that the earliest Greeks valued the learned far less than those in whom nature manifested itself foremost, the first such rewards were bestowed for athletic training. Thus, the greatest men among the Greeks sought to distinguish themselves in their youth at the games. Chrysippos and Kleanthes achieved fame here before they were known for philosophy. Even Plato himself appeared among the wrestlers in the Isthmian games at Corinth and in the Pythian games at Sikyon. Pythagoras took the prize at Elis, and he coached Eurymenes to victory at the same place. Among the Romans as well, athletic exercises were the way to make a name for oneself, and Papirius, who avenged upon the Samnites the shame of the Romans at Furculae Caudinae, is known to us less for this victory than for his epithet, “Runner”, which Homer also gave to Achilles.

(Note-to-self: Include other references)

For just as the mind of a man accustomed to reflection tends to rise higher in a wide field or on an open path or at the top of a building than in a low chamber or in any restricted place, so also the way of thinking among the free Greeks must have been very different from the concepts of subjugated peoples. Greeks in their prime were contemplative beings: they were already thinking twenty years or more before we generally begin to think for ourselves, and they exercised the mind when it was most fired up by the sprightliness of the body, whereas with us the mind is ignobly nourished until it decays.

The use and the application of art preserved it in its grandeur. As art was dedicated only to deities and reserved for the homeland’s holiest and most useful functions, and as moderation and simplicity dwelt in the houses of the citizens, so the artist was constrained neither to trifles or playthings nor by the limitations of the place or the lewdness of the owner; rather his work conformed to the proud concepts of the whole people. Miltiades, Themistocles, Aristeides, and Cimon — the leaders and saviors of Greece -lived no better than their neighbors. Tombs were regarded as sacred buildings, however, so it must not have been unusual when Nikias, the celebrated painter, was commissioned to paint a tomb outside of the city of Triteia in Achaia. We must also consider how much emulation in art was encouraged when whole cities competed with one another for an exceptional statue or when a whole people contributed to the costs for statues of the gods as well as of the victors in the public games. Some cities were known, even in antiquity itself, merely for a beautiful statue, as was Alipheira for a bronze Pallas made by Hekatodoros and Sostratos.

The Jupiter of Pheidias and the Juno of Polykleitos —the most perfect statues known to antiquity— were done before light and shadow appeared in Greek painting. Sculpture enhanced religious practice and in turn was nurtured by it. But the works of painters do not appear to have been objects of sacred reverence and adoration by the Greeks. Painting and sculpture related to each other like oratory and poetry: the latter, which, because it was held to be more sacred than the former, was employed in sacred acts and particularly rewarded, attained perfection earlier; and this in part is the reason why, as Cicero says, there were more good poets than good orators.

### The Essentials of Art

I shall speak first of beauty in general, second of proportion, and then of the beauty of the individual parts of the human body. In my general reflections on beauty, I shall initially touch on the variant concept of beauty, namely, the negative conception of beauty, and then I can give a somewhat more definite concept of beauty —for, as Cicero’s Cotta says of the divine, it is easier to say what beauty is not than what it is. Beauty is one of the great mysteries of nature: we all see and feel its effect, but a general and clear concept of its essence remains among the undiscovered truths.

This difference of opinion shows itself still more in judgments between beauties portrayed in art and those found in nature itself. For, because the former provokes us less than the latter, the former will —when it is formed in accordance with concepts of higher beauty and is more serious than frivolous —please the uneducated mind less than a commonly pretty appearance that can move and act. Given this, young people, in whom the desires seethe and ferment, will see goddesses in countenances evincing a languishing and ardent allure even if not truly beautiful, and they will be less affected by a truly beautiful woman with the appearance and majesty of a Juno whose gestures and actions display breeding and wealth.

In others, the climate did not allow the delicate feeling for pure beauty to mature. Either this feeling was hardened in them by their skill, that is, by the effort to apply their knowledge everywhere in the production of youthful beauties, as with Michelangelo; or this feeling was over time completely corrupted in them by a vulgar flattery of the coarser senses so as to render everything more readily intelligible to the eye, as happened with Bernini. The former occupied himself with the contemplation of high beauty, as we see from his published and unpublished poems, in which he reflected upon it with noble and elevated expressions, and with massive bodies, he is admirable.

Beauty is experienced by the senses, but it is recognized and understood by reason, which in most cases renders, or should render, the senses less susceptible but more correct.

A positive conception, however, demands knowledge of the essence itself, into which we are capable of looking in a few cases. Because here, as in most philosophical studies, we cannot proceed in the manner used in geometry and reach conclusions by proceeding from the general to the particular and individual and from the essence of things to their attributes, we must instead be content with drawing probable conclusions from nothing but individual pieces. The wise who have pondered the causes of universal beauty, exploring its presence in created things and seeking to reach the source of highest beauty, have located it in the perfect harmony of beings with their purposes and of the parts with one another and with the whole.

The highest beauty is in God, and the concept of human beauty will approach perfection the more it can be conceived in accordance and in harmony with the highest being who differentiates for us the concept of unity and indivisibility apart from matter. This concept of beauty is like a spirit separated from matter by fire that seeks to create a being conforming to the exact image of the first intelligent creature sketched in the mind of God. The forms of such an image are simple and uninterrupted, manifold in their unity, and thus they are harmonious —just as a sweet and pleasing tone is brought forth by bodies whose parts are uniform. All beauty is enhanced by unity and simplicity, as is everything we say and do: for what is great in itself is enhanced when realized and presented with simplicity. It will not be narrowly constrained or lose any of its greatness if our mind can survey and measure it at a glance, contain and comprehend it in a single concept. Instead, it is just this conceivability that enables us to imagine it in its full greatness, and our spirit is expanded and at the same time elevated by comprehending it.

The harmony that delights our spirit resides not in infinitely broken, linked, or slurred notes but in simple and long-sustained tones. This is why a large palace appears small when overladen with decoration and a house seems large when it is simply and elegantly executed. From this unity proceeds another attribute of high beauty —its unspecifiability, that is, its forms are defined neither by points nor by lines, for they in and of themselves constitute beauty; accordingly, a shape should neither be particular to this or that specific person nor express any one state of mind or sensation of passion, for that would mix foreign features into beauty and disturb the unity. According to this conception, beauty should be like the purest water drawn from the source of a spring: the less taste it has, the healthier it is seen to be, because it is clear of all foreign particles. 

Yet as human nature has no state midway between pain and pleasure, to again cite Epicurus, and as the passions are the winds propelling our ship on the sea of life, by which the poet sets sail and the artist elevates himself, so pure beauty alone cannot be the only object of our consideration; we must also place it in a state of action and passion, which in art we understand by the word expression. We shall therefore treat first the appearance of beauty and second its expression.

The appearance of beauty is either individual, that is, tending toward the singular, or a selection of beautiful parts from many individuals and their combination into one, which we call ideal. The appearance of beauty began with the singular beauty, in the imitation of a beautiful subject as well as in the representation of the gods, and even during the period of art's blossoming, goddesses were modeled on beautiful women.

The gymnasiums and other places where youths practiced wrestling and other sports naked, and to which one went to see beautiful youth, were the schools where the artists examined the beauty of the body’s build, and the daily opportunity to view the most beautiful naked youths heated the imagination, and the beauty of forms became natural and actual to them.

Among the Ionian Greeks in Asia Minor, the creation of such equivocal beauties became a sacred devotional practice with the castrated priests of Cybele. In the beautiful youth, the artist found the source of beauty in unity, variety, and harmony —for the forms of a beautiful body are defined by lines that continually change their center point, never tracing a circle, and thus the forms are simpler but also more varied than a circle, which, however large or small it may be, always has the same center point and encloses others within itself or is itself enclosed.

The greater the unity in the combination of forms, and in the flowing of one from the other, the greater the beauty of the whole. A beautiful youthful creature is fashioned from such forms like the unity of the surface of the sea, which from a distance appears flat and still, like a mirror, even though it is constantly in motion and rolls in waves.

One should note, however, that I speak here merely of the perception and appearance of beauty in a strict sense, not of the science of drawing and execution. For with regard to the latter, more science can reside in and be applied to strong rather than tender figures, and the Laokoon is a much more learned work than the Belvedere Apollo, Hagesandros, the master of the principal figure of the Laokoon, must have been a far more skillful and accomplished artist than the master of the Apollo. Nevertheless, the latter must have been gifted with a more elevated spirit and a more tender soul: the Apollo has a sublimity that the Laokoon does not.

Nevertheless, the nature and build of the most beautiful bodies is rarely without fault, and they have forms or parts that can be found or imagined more perfectly in other bodies. Accordingly, this experience led these wise artists to proceed like a skilled gardener, who grafts different shoots of a noble species onto one stem. And as a bee gathers from many flowers, so their concept of beauty was not limited to the individual attributes of a single beauty —as are at times the conceptions of ancient and modern poets, and of most artists of the present day.

Others have been able to think only of individual beauties, and their thesis is as follows: ancient statues are beautiful because they resemble the beauty of nature; and nature will always be beautiful when it resembles beautiful statues. The first proposition is true, but in aggregate, not in particular; the second proposition is false, for it is difficult, indeed almost impossible, to find a natural creation like the Vatican Apollo. The mind of a rationally thinking being has an innate inclination toward and desire to rise above matter into the mental realm of concepts, and its true satisfaction is the production of new and refined ideas. The great Greek artists — who viewed themselves as new creators, so to speak, though they worked less for the mind than for the senses — sought to overcome the hard objectivity of matter and, if it had been possible, to animate it.

For from their hands came the objects of sacred veneration, which, to inspire veneration, had to appear to be images taken from higher forms. The first founders of religion, who were poets, bestowed exalted concepts on these images, and these gave wings to the imagination to elevate their achievement above itself and above the sensuous. What human conception of sensuous divinity could be worthier and more enchanting to the imagination than the state of eternal youth and the springtime of life, whose recollection even in our later years can gladden us? This accorded with the concept of the immutability of the divine being, and a beautiful, youthful embodiment of the deity awakened tenderness and love, which could transport the soul into a sweet dream of ecstasy, the state of human bliss sought by all religions, whether correctly understood or not.

The spiritual nature of the gods is at the same time depicted in their easy gait, and Homer compares the swiftness of Juno’s walk with a man’s thought, by which he travels through the many distant lands that he has toured and in an instant says, "Here I have been, and there I was.“ An illustration of this is the running of Atalanta, who sped so quickly across the sands that she left behind no footprints; and the Atalanta on an amethyst in the Stosch museo seems just that light.

The first male ideal has its different stages and begins with fauns, as lowly conceptions of deities. The finest statues of fauns present an image of ripe, beautiful, perfectly proportioned youth, and their youth differs from that of young heroes through a certain innocence and simplicity. This was the common conception of these deities among the Greeks. The beautiful Barberini sleeping faun is no ideal but rather an image of simple, unaffected nature.

The highest concept of an ideal male youth is particularly well conceived in Apollo, in whom is combined the vigor of maturity with the soft forms of the most beautiful springtime of youth. These forms are grand in their youthful unity — not those of a favorite wandering in the cool shade and reared on roses by Venus, as Ibykos says, but those of a noble youth born to great things. Thus, Apollo was the most beautiful of the gods. Health flourishes in this youth, and vigor makes itself felt, like the dawn of a beautiful day. If an imagination filled with the individual beauties of nature and absorbed in the contemplation of the beauty flowing from and leading to God could dream the vision of an angel, its countenance illuinated by divine light, with an appearance that seems to emanate from the source of the highest unity —in such a shape the reader should imagine this beautiful statue. One could say that nature, with God’s sanction, fashioned it after the beauty of the angels. The beautiful youth found in Apollo advances, step by step, to its fully realized years in other gods, and is more masculine in Mercury and Mars. But it never occurred to an artist in antiquity to represent Mars as our previously criticized writer wishes to present him, that is, as one in whom even the most negligible fiber expresses the vigor, boldness, and fire that animates him.

The image of Bacchus is that of a beautiful boy approaching the limits of the springtime of life and adolescence, in whom the stirrings of desire begin to sprout like the delicate shoot of a plant, and who begins, like one between slumber and wakefulness, half sunk in an enchanting dream, to collect images of himself and to make himself real: his features are full of sweetness but the joyousness of the soul is not fully present in his face. The beauty of male deities in adulthood consists in an embodiment of the vigor of maturity and the joyousness of youth, and this is evinced here in the lack of nerves and tendons, which in the prime of life are expressed less. The presence or absence of these parts distinguishes a Herakles who has to contend with enormous and powerful men and has not yet reached the end of his labors from a Herakles whose body has been purified by fire and elevated to the enjoyment of the bliss of Olympus.

Nature was elevated by such concepts from the sensual to the eternal, and the hand of the artist produced physiques that were purged of human need. Figures that represent humanity in a higher state of worthiness appear to be merely the cloak and accouterments of rational spirits and heavenly powers. The ancients shaped the forms of heroes heroically and endowed certain parts with a sublimity greater than found in nature. They gave the muscles a quickness of action and movement, and in violent poses, they set all the natural impulses in motion. This can be seen even more clearly in exactly these muscles on the Laokoon, in which nature is enhanced by the ideal, as compared with these body parts on deified or divine figures, such as the Herakles and the Apollo in the Belvedere. The movement of Laokoon’s muscles is driven beyond truth to the limits of possibility; they lie like hills that flow into one another, in order to express the greatest exertion of powers in suffering and resisting. In the Torso of the deified Herakles, these same muscles have a highly idealized form and beauty, but they are like the surge of a calm sea, flowing sublimely in a gently changing beat. In Apollo, the image of the most beautiful god, these muscles are subtle, blown like molten glass into scarcely visible undulations and more apparent to the touch than to sight.

Juno is shown as a woman and a goddess elevated above others in physique as well as regal pride. The beauty in the glance of Juno’s large, arched eyes is commanding, like a queen who wants to rule, be revered, and inspire love. The most beautiful head of her is the colossal one in the Villa Ludovisi. Pallas - the image of maidenly chastity divested of all feminine weakness, vanquishing even love — has eyes that are more moderately arched and less open; her head is not haughtily raised, and her glance is somewhat lowered, as in still contemplation. The most beautiful figure of her is in the Villa Albani. Venus has a glance yet different from both these goddesses, which is produced in particular by the lower eyelid being somewhat raised, whereby in her gently opened eyes, there arises an ogling and languishing air, which the Greeks called running, melting, languishing. Still, she is at a far remove from all the salacious gestures of the moderns, because love was regarded by the best artists of antiquity as a companion to wisdom. Diana is gifted with all the charms of her sex, without appearing to be conscious of them: for as she is represented running or walking, so her glance is directed straight ahead and into the distance, beyond all nearby objects. She always appears as a maiden, and with her hair tied at the crown, like them, or even at a distance from the head. The Jupiter of Pheidias, the Juno of Polykleitos, a Venus by Alkamenes, and a later one by Praxiteles will have been regarded as the worthiest prototypes by all their successors and will have been adopted and worshipped by all Greeks in these forms. The Vatican Apollo was intended to represent this deity in a state of displeasure over the dragon Python, which he has slain with his arrow, and at the same time scornful of this victory, so negligible for a god. Achilles should also be depicted with blond hair, judging from Homer and Pindar. Homer always calls Menelaos “the blond,” and Pindar gives the same name to the Graces.

Stillness is the state most proper to beauty, as it is to the sea, and experience shows that the most beautiful beings are of a still and well-mannered nature. Likewise, the conception of high beauty cannot be produced other than in a tranquil contemplation of the soul withdrawn from all individual appearances.

Ancient artists displayed the same wisdom in representing figures from the heroic age as well as the merely human passions, which were at all times in accordance with the composure of a wise man, who suppresses the surge of emotions and allows only the sparks from the fire to be seen; he seeks to discover the hidden motives of those who wish to honor or unmask him. This same composure is appropriate to his speech as well; it is for this reason that Homer compared the words of Odysseus to snowflakes that fall abundantly but softly to earth. In representing heroes, the artist is allowed less latitude than the poet. The latter can portray them as they were in their own time, when the passions were as yet unrestrained by authority or by the artificial decorum of life, because the attributes represented in poetry have a necessary relation to the age and the condition of man but not to his figure. The artist, however, because he must select the most beautiful parts of the most beautiful appearances, is limited as to the level of expression of the passions, which must not become detrimental to the appearance.

Such a state, in which feeling and thought cease, and which is akin to indifference, changes no aspect of shape and appearance, and the great artist could fashion here, as he did, the very highest beauty — for Niobe and her daughters are and remain the most exalted ideas of it. Laokoon is an image of the most extreme suffering, which acts here on all the muscles, nerves, and veins; the blood boils intensely from the deadly bite of the serpent, and all parts of the body express exertion and pain, whereby the artist made visible every impulse of nature and displayed his great science and art.

In the end, nature is the best teacher with regard to the beauty of the individual parts of the human body, for in regard to particulars, nature is superior to art, just as in regard to the whole, art can rise above nature.

### The Beauty of Statues

Since white is the color that reflects the most rays of light, and thus is most easily perceived, a beautiful body will be all the more beautiful the whiter it is, and nude it will thereby appear larger than it actually is, just as all newly formed gypsum figures seem larger than the statues from which they were cast.

In the appearance of the face, the so-called Greek profile is the chief characteristic of a high beauty. This profile consists of a nearly straight or gently concave line, which describes the forehead and nose on youthful heads, especially female ones. Nature forms this profile less in a cold climate than in a mild one, but wherever it is found, the form of the face can be beautiful, for the grand is formed by straightness and completeness, the tender by gently concave forms. That a cause of beauty resides in this profile is proven by its opposite: the stronger the indentation of the nose, the more it deviates from beautiful form; and if on a face seen from the side, a bad profile appears, one can spare oneself the trouble of looking around for something beautiful in it.

The beauty of eyebrows resides in a thin line of fine hair, as it is to be found thus on the most beautiful creatures in nature. Indeed, on the most beautiful heads in art, they are represented by an almost cutting sharpness: among the Greeks, these were called “eyebrows of the Graces. ” But when the eyebrows were very arched, they were compared to a drawn bow or to snails and were never held to be beautiful. One of the beauties of the eyes is the size, just as a large pupil is more pleasing than a small one. The size is suited, however, to the orbit, or the sockets, and expresses itself in the cut and opening of the eyelids, of which in beautiful eyes the upper lid describes a rounder curve toward the inner corner than does the lower lid. Yet not all large eyes are beautiful, and protruding eyes never are.

The Pallas of Pheidias, whose head was made of ivory, had gems for the pupils of its eyes. From the indications of some ancient writers, a beautiful forehead should be low; and yet a clear, expansive forehead is not unattractive, but rather the reverse. This seeming contradiction can be easily explained: the forehead of a youth should be low, as he is in the prime of life, before the hairline has receded and left the forehead bare. It would therefore be uncharacteristic of youth to be depicted with a clear, high forehead, which is, however, appropriate for a mature man.

The beauty of a youthful hand resides in a very moderate fullness with scarcely noticeably concave marks — like soft shadows — at the knuckles of the fingers, where dimples are on full hands. The fingers are drawn with a lovely taper, like finely shaped columns, and in art the joints of the fingers are not indicated; the little finger is not, as with modern artists, curved over in front. A beautiful foot was more evident in antiquity than today, and the less constrained it was, the more well-shaped was its form, which was minutely observed by the ancients, as is made clear by particular remarks of ancient philosophers regarding the feet and by the conclusions they drew about the emotional state of the person. Thus, in descriptions of attractive persons, such as Polyxena and Aspasia, their beautiful feet are mentioned as well, and the bad feet of the emperor Domitian are also recorded in history. The toenails are flatter on ancient feet than on more modern statues.

The abdomen on male figures should be like that of a man after a sweet sleep and healthy digestion, that is, without a belly, a condition that physicians take to be a sign of a long life.

To these reflections on beauty, I attach a memorandum that can serve youthful beginners and travelers as their first and most important lesson on viewing Greek figures. Seek not to discover the deficiencies and imperfections in works of art before you have learned to recognize and find beauty. This memorandum is based on my daily experience of observing that beauty goes unrecognized by the majority of people because they wish to play the critic before they have begun to be students. Our vanity will not allow us to pass by with only an idle gaze, and our self-complacency wants to be flattered; therefore we seek to pass judgment. But just as it is easier to make a negative statement than a positive one, so imperfections are much more easy to observe and detect than perfection; and it takes less effort to judge others than it takes to improve ourselves. When approaching a beautiful statue, we often praise its beauty in general terms, because this costs nothing; and if the eye has strayed over the statue with an uncertain and fluttering look and not found the good in its parts, along with reasons for it, the eye fixes on the faults.  Rather, they should approach them with a much more positive bias, for in the conviction that much beauty is to be found, they will seek it, and some of it will reveal itself to them. One must return again and again until it is found: for it is present.

This treatise on the drawing of the nude by Greek artists does not exhaust the subject, as I am well aware; but I believe that I have provided a thread that one can seize and rightly follow. Rome, more so than elsewhere, is the place where these reflections can be tested and applied. The proper judgment regarding them and their full utility is not to be made in passing, however, or exhausted either: for that which at the outset might seem not to conform to the meaning of the author will, upon repeated reflection, correspond to it more closely and will confirm the author’s long experience and the mature deliberations of this treatise.

Linen can be recognized in works of sculpture as well as in paintings by its transparency and by its flat, small folds. Figures were dressed in this kind of clothing not because artists were imitating the damp linen in which they clothed their models but because the oldest inhabitants of Athens, as Thucydides and other Greeks wrote, dressed in linen —a remark that, as Herodotus suggests, should be understood as applying only to women’s tunics. Linen was still the attire worn in Athens not long before the time of these writers, and it was proper to women. On female figures, should someone take that which appears to be linen for some other light material, it would make no difference. Linen, in any case, must have been frequently worn among the Greeks, as the finest and most beautiful flax was cultivated and spun in the region around Elis. The principal light fabric was cotton, which was grown and woven on the island of Kos, and it was the material used for women’s clothing among both the Greeks and the Romans; if men dressed in cotton, they were called effeminate.

The smooth surface and bright reflection of the silk causes the different colors in the garment; this effect does not occur with either wool or cotton, because of their fuzzy threads and rough surface. That Greek women wore silk clothing in the best period of Greece is not recorded in written sources; but we see this in the works of their artists, among them four paintings recently discovered in Herculaneum that could have been painted before imperial times: one could say that the painters must have had a silk garment to dress their models in. 

Wool is recognizable by its large folds and by the creases into which the wool set when folded up. In the earliest periods, women’s attire was the same for all Greeks, that is, it was Doric. In later periods, the Ionians distinguished their attire from that of the others. Artists, however, seem to have adhered mainly to the earliest style of dress for their heroic and divine figures. 

The fully dressed Venus is always represented in marble with two girdles. The second of these lies below the belly, as we see both on the Venus with a portrait head that stands next to the Mars on the Campidogho and on the beautifully dressed Venus that formerly stood in the Palazzo Spada. This lower girdle is unique to this goddess and is called, by poets in particular, “the girdle of Venus”—something not previously noticed by anyone. Hera borrowed this girdle when she wished to stir in Zeus a violent desire for her, and she placed it, as Homer says, in her lap, that is, around and below the belly, where it lies on the figure mentioned above. It was presumably for the same reason that the Syrians placed this girdle on statues of Hera. Gori believes that two of the three Graces on a funeral urn are holding this girdle in their hands, which cannot be proven. In elegance, which is the second point in our consideration of the drawing of clothed figures, lies much of note for style and periods. Elegance in clothing, which in antiquity belonged chiefly to women’s clothing, in art resided especially in the fold. In the earliest period, folds for the most part ran in straight lines or in very slight curves —although a writer not very enlightened in these matters said this was true for all folds from antiquity.

When, however, it was the ancient artist’s intention to show the beauty of the nude, he always downplayed the splendor of the gown, as we see in the daughters of Niobe: their clothes almost cling to the flesh and only the hollows are covered; on the raised parts, by contrast, light folds are drawn, to indicate a garment. In the drawing of clothed figures, fine sensitivity and feeling, both in observing and teaching and in imitating, are less important than attentive observation and knowledge. Still, the connoisseur in this branch of art has no less to study than does the artist. In this regard, clothing is to the nude what the expression of thoughts, that is, their clothing, is to the thoughts themselves; it often costs less effort to find the latter than the former.

Grace was sought not only in demeanor and action but also in the clothing (just as the oldest Graces were rendered clothed). And if in our time, beauty in the drawing of the nude can be learned from four or five of the most beautiful statues, the artist has to study clothing in a hundred such works.

### Different Stages of Greek Art

For just as each action and event has five parts or stages — beginning, development, plateau, waning, and end, which is the reason for the five scenes or acts in theatrical pieces — so it is with the chronological succession of Greek art. But as its end lies outside of the limits of art, there are actually only four periods to consider here. The more ancient style lasted until the time of Pheidias. Through him, and through the artists of his time, art achieved its greatness, and we can call this style the grand or high style. From the time of Praxiteles to that of Lysippos and Apelles, art acquired more grace and complaisance, and this style can be called the beautiful style. Sometime after these artists and their schools, art began to decline into imitation of their work, and we can define a third style, that of the imitators, which lasted until art gradually declined to its fall.

We can therefore summarize the distinguishing features and characteristics of this more ancient style as follows: its drawing was emphatic but hard, powerful but without grace, and its forceful expression diminished its beauty. This is to be understood as occurring in stages, however, since the more ancient style spans the longest period of Greek art, so that later works would have been very different from earlier ones.

The characteristics of this more ancient style also prepared the way for the high style of art and guided it to strict accuracy and high expression —for in the hardness of the former style, the precisely described contour and the certainty of knowledge whereby everything is laid bare to the eye become manifest. In just the same way, the art of recent times would have arrived, by way of the sharp contour and by way of the emphatic indication of all parts by Michelangelo, at its height, if sculptors had remained on this track. For, as in learning music and languages, in the one the tone and in the other the syllables and words must be sharply and precisely rendered in order to attain pure harmony and fluent expression, so drawing obtains truth and beauty of form not by indecisive, aimless, and faintly indicated features but by manly, if somewhat hard and precisely defined contours. With a similar style, and at the same time when art was making great strides toward its perfection, tragedy raised itself in the powerful words and strong expressions of great weight by which Aeschylus gave sublimity to his characters and amplitude to probability.

The closest predecessors to the greatest painters finished their works with unbelievable patience and sought, in part by rendering the smallest details, to diffuse a brilliance over their paintings to which they could not give grandeur; indeed, the greatest artists, Michelangelo and Raphael, worked as a British poet instructed: "write with Fury, but correct with Phleam."

Finally, at the time when full enlightenment and freedom appeared in Greece, art likewise became freer and more elevated. The more ancient style was built on a system consisting of rules that were taken from nature and subsequently departed from it and became ideal. The artist worked more according to the direction of these rules than according to nature, which was to be imitated —for art had formed its own nature. Those who improved art raised themselves above this accepted system and drew nearer to the truth of nature. Nature taught them to depart from hardness and to transform the projecting and suddenly truncated parts of figures into flowing contours, to make the violent poses and actions more civilized and judicious, and to offer not so much the learned as the beautiful, elevated, and grand. By way of this improvement of art, Pheidias, Polykleitos, Skopas, Alkamenes, and Myron made themselves famous. The style itself can be called the grand style, because — aside from beauty —the most notable aim of these artists seems to have been grandeur. Because these masters, like Polykleitos, were legislators of proportion, and thus would have established the measure of each part punctiliously, it is not improbable that beautiful form was to a certain degree sacrificed to this great correctness.

Similarly, to uncultivated minds, the Homeric measure and the ancient majesty of Lucretius and Catullus sound careless and coarse when compared with the polish of Virgil and the sweet mellifluousness of Ovid. If Lucian’s judgment of art is valid, however, the statue of the Amazon Sosandra, by the hand of Kalamis, would be placed among the four most excellent figures of female beauty. In his description of its beauty, he cites not only her whole attire but also her modest mien and a swift and secret smile. Nevertheless, the style of a period in art can no more be general than a manner of writing can be. If from the writers of that time only Thucydides had survived, we would have formed from the abbreviated obscurity of the speeches in his history an erroneous conclusion about Plato, Lysias, and Xenophon, whose words flow like a gentle brook.

The former statue is worthy of the great artists of this period, and because we see the head in all its pristine beauty, judgment of it can be that much more correct. It has not been injured by as much as a harsh breath but is as immaculate and lustrous as when it left the hands of its master. In the high beauty with which it is endowed, this head has the distinguishing features of this style, and in them is displayed a certain hardness, which can be felt more than it can be described, however. One might wish to see in the face a certain grace, by which it would have achieved more roundness and softness, and this is presumably the grace that Praxiteles, in the succeeding period of art, was the first to give his figures.

This beauty is like an idea conceived without the help of the senses that might be produced in a lofty understanding and a happy imagination if it could soar to seeing nearly as far as divine beauty; it is of such great unity of form and contour that it seems not to have been produced laboriously but to have been awakened like an idea and imbued with the breath of life. The beautiful style in art commences with Praxiteles and attained its greatest luster with Lysippos and Apelles; thus, this is the style just prior to and during the time of Alexander the Great and his successors. The chief characteristic distinguishing this style from the high style is grace, and in this regard the artists just mentioned have the same relation to their predecessors as among the moderns Guido has to Raphael. This will become clearer in considering the drawing of this style and its particular constituent, grace.

But the forms of beauty of the previous style remained the rule in this new style as well, for they had been taught by the most beautiful nature. Thus, in his description of beauty, Lucian took the whole and the main parts from the artists of the high style, and he took elegance from their successors. The form of the face should be like that of the Lemnian Venus of Pheidias, but the hair, eyebrows, and forehead should be like those of the Venus of Praxiteles, and in the eyes, Lucian wished to see the tenderness and charm of the latter. In general, we can imagine the figures of the high style in relation to those of the beautiful style just as we would imagine men from the heroic age, such as Homer’s heroes and men, in relation to the cultured Athenians during the blossoming of their republic. Or, to draw a comparison to something real, I would set the works from the former period alongside Demosthenes and those of the succeeding period together with Cicero. The former carries us off impetuously, as it were; the latter takes us with him willingly. The former leaves us no time to reflect on the beauties of the execution; with the latter, these beauties appear unaffected and spread a general light over the arguments of the speaker.

Grace is formed and resides in gestures and displays itself in the action and movement of the body; it is even expressed in the fall of the clothing and in the whole garb. By the artists who succeeded Pheidias, Polykleitos, and their contemporaries, it was sought and attained more than before. The reason for this must lie in the loftiness of the ideas that formed these artists and in the rigor of their drawing, and this point deserves our particular attention. The celebrated great masters of the high style sought beauty only in a perfect harmony of parts and in an elevated expression, and they strove for true beauty more than charm. But because only a single concept of the beauty that is the highest and always identical could be imagined, and because this concept was constantly present to those artists, their beauties always had to approach this image and become similar to one another and uniform.

Now if a tenet of the high style was — as it seems — to represent the face and attitude of the deities and heroes as freed from emotion and removed from inner agitation, in an equilibrium of feeling and with a peaceful and always equable soul, then a certain grace was neither sought nor introduced. This expression of a significant and eloquent stillness of the soul demands a lofty understanding, however: "For the imitation of violence can be done in different ways, but a still and wise nature can neither be easily imitated nor, when imitated, easily comprehended" as Plato declares. With such rigorous concepts of beauty, art, like well-ordered states with strict laws, began to become great. The immediate successors to the great legislators of art did not act as Solon did with the laws of Draco; they did not depart from them. But, just as the most correct laws can be made more workable and amenable with a moderate interpretation, so these artists sought to bring closer to nature those high beauties that in the statues of their great masters were like ideas abstracted from nature and forms modeled on a system, and in just this way they attained a greater variety. This is how we understand the grace with which the masters of the beautiful style endowed their works.

But Grace, who, like the Muses, was worshipped under just two names among the ancient Greeks, appears to be like Venus, whose playmates are of a twofold nature. The one is, like the heavenly Venus, of a higher birth and formed of harmony; she is constant and unchanging, like the eternal laws of harmony. The second Grace is, like the Venus born of Dione, more subject to matter; she is a daughter of time and only an attendant on the first, which she heralds to those who are not consecrated to the heavenly Grace. She willingly descends from her elevated state and reveals herself with benevolence, without degradation, to those who cast their eyes upon her; she is not eager to please but does not remain incognito. The first Grace, a companion to all the gods, appears sufficient to herself, however. She does not offer herself but wishes to be sought. She is too sublime to make herself very sensual, for "the highest has no image,“ as Plato says. She converses only with the wise and appears resistant and inaccessible to the common people. She locks inside herself the stirrings of the soul and approaches the blissful stillness of divine nature, which the great artists, as the ancients wrote, sought to capture in an image. The Greeks would have compared the first Grace to the Ionian mode, the second to the Dorian. 

He became a creator of pure spirits and heavenly souls who excite no carnal desires but effect a vivid contemplation of all beauty: Niobe and her daughters seem not to be formed by passion but only to have absorbed it. The artists of the beautiful style brought together the first and highest Grace with the second. And just as the Homeric Juno took the girdle of Venus so as to appear more lovely and pleasing to Jupiter, so these masters sought to accompany high beauty with a sensuous charm and to render grandeur more convivial, as it were, through an accommodating loveliness. Yet a half-century separated Parrhasios, who was a contemporary of Pheidias, from Praxiteles, whose work, as far as we know, distinguished itself from previously executed works by a special grace. It is noteworthy that both the father of this Grace in art and Apelles, who made her entirely his own and can be called her true painter insofar as he painted her in particular alone, without her two companions, were born under the sensual Ionian sky and in the land where the father of poets had been gifted, some centuries earlier, with the highest grace.

Variety and greater diversity of expression did no harm to the harmony and grandeur of the beautiful style: the soul manifested itself only as if under a still surface of water and never erupted tempestuously. In the representation of suffering, the greatest pain remained locked away, as in the Laokoon; and joy floats like a gentle breeze, which scarcely ruffles the leaves, on the face of a bacchante on coins from the island of Naxos. Art philosophized with the passions, as Aristotle says of reason. If the high style did not allow itself to stoop to the immature forms of young children, and if the artists of this style, whose most refined studies were directed toward perfect physiques, did not concern themselves with superfluous fleshiness —though this is something of which we cannot be sure —it is nonetheless certain that their successors in the beautiful style not only sought the tender and the pleasing but also allowed the nature of the child to be a subject of their art. 

Because the proportions and forms of beauty had been so intensively studied by artists in antiquity, and because the contours of the figures had been so fully defined that they could be shifted neither outward nor inward without error, the concept of beauty could not be driven any higher. Thus, the path was opened to imitation. This cramps the spirit, and if it is not possible to surpass a Praxiteles or an Apelles, it is difficult to equal them, and the imitator has always remained inferior to the imitated. Corruption has always crept into writing in the very same way; and music forsook the manly and, like art, declined into the effeminate. Just so the good is often lost in the artificial, because one always wants something better. In any case, it is to the credit of antiquity that it remained conscious of its own grandeur up to the fall of art. The ancients never completely departed from the spirit of their fathers, and even mediocre works of the late period were still executed according to the principles of the great masters. The heads kept to the shared concept of antique beauty, and in posture, action, and dress, the figures always demonstrated traces of a pure truth and simplicity.

To reiterate and summarize what has been said in this section: in Greek art, and particularly in Greek sculpture, we can identify four stylistic stages, namely, the straight and hard, the grand and angular, the beautiful and flowing, and the style of the imitators. The first probably lasted until the time of Pheidias; the second until Praxiteles, Lysippos, and Apelles; the third waned with their schools; and the fourth continued until the fall of art. Art did not sustain its highest blossoming for long, for it was only some 120 years from the age of Pericles to Alexander's death, when art’s glory began to decline. The fate of art in general in more recent times is, with regard to periods, like that of antiquity: there are likewise four major changes, with only this distinction — art did not gradually descend from its heights, as among the Greeks; instead, as soon as it attained the highest level then possible with two great men (I am speaking here only of drawing), it suddenly plummeted down again. Style was dry and stiff until Michelangelo and Raphael; these two men were responsible for restoring art to its heights. After an interval, in which bad taste prevailed, came the style of the imitators; this was the style of the Carracci and their school, along with their followers, and this period lasted until Carlo Maratti. If we speak of sculpture in particular, however, its history is very short: it flourished and came to an end with Michelangelo and Sansovino; Algardi, II Fiammingo, and Rusconi came more than a hundred years later.

Still, the beautiful and the useful are not to be grasped at a glance, as an unwise German painter thought after a few weeks of his stay in Rome: for the significant and the difficult run deep and do not flow on the surface. The first sight of a beautiful statue is, to him who has feeling, like the first view of the open sea, wherein our gaze loses itself and becomes fixed, but after repeated contemplation, the soul becomes more still and the eye quieter and moves from the whole to the particular. We should explain works of art to ourselves in the same manner that we might explain an ancient writer to another — for generally, it works just like reading a book: we believe that we understand what we read, but we find we do not understand it when we seek to explain it clearly. It is one thing to read Homer, but another to translate him while reading.

### External Circumstances of the Time Among the Greeks 

For the sciences, and even philosophy itself, are subject to time and its changes — and this is even more true for art, which is nurtured and supported by affluence and, often, by vanity.

After the tyrants in Greece, including those who had governed Sikyon benevolently and legally, had been eradicated, and after the sons of Peisistratos had been banished or slain — which happened in the 67th Olympiad, and thus at about same time that Brutus liberated his native land — the Greeks raised their heads higher than ever, and a new spirit overtook this nation. With this victory, the Athenians raised themselves above all other cities, and as the Athenians were the first among the Greeks to become more civilized and to lay aside their arms —without which in the earliest times no Greek appeared in public, even during periods of peace — so their reputation and increasing power made this city the principal seat of the arts and sciences in Greece. From this time forward, all the powers in Greece seem to have been set in motion, and the great gifts of this nation began to manifest themselves more than ever. The extraordinary men and great minds that had been developing since the start of the great movement in Greece now emerged all at once. In the 77th Olympiad, Herodotus came from Caria to Elis and read his history to all the Greeks who were assembled there; not long before, Pherekydes had written the first work of prose. Aeschylus brought to light the first regular tragedies in the elevated style; up until then, ever since their invention in the 61st Olympiad, such plays had consisted solely of dances with people singing. These events were, so to speak, the great preliminaries to the perfection of art, which now advanced in vigorous strides.

The Greeks now began to show an intensified love for their native land, for which so many courageous men had suffered injury and death, and which now could be regarded as secure against any human power. Each city began to think of its own embellishment and of splendid buildings and temples. These great initiatives made artists indispensable and gave them the opportunity to show themselves equal to other great men.

In those days was laid a foundation for the greatness of Greece on which a splendid and lasting edifice could be erected. The philosophers and poets were the first to put their hands to the task, the artists completed it, and history leads us to it through a splendid portal. The Greeks of that time must have been no less astonished than those few who today still know the Greek poets to see just a few years after a presumably perfect tragedy by Aeschylus, one by Sophocles that reached the highest limit of human powers not by degrees but in one inconceivable bound. He produced Antigone, his first tragedy, in the third year of the 77th Olympiad. Art will have made just such a leap from master to student, from Ageladas to Polykleitos; and if time had not deprived us of the means of judging both works, we believe that the distance from the Herakles to the Jupiter by Pheidias and from the Jupiter by Ageladas to the Juno by Polykleitos would equal that from the Prometheus of Aeschylus to the Oedipus of Sophocles. The former is, in the loftiness of his thoughts and the splendor of his expression, more astonishing than moving; and in the design of his story, which is more real than probable, he is less a poet than a narrator. While the latter touches the heart through inner feelings that penetrate to the soul less through words than through sensitive images; and through the utmost probability he could conceive, through the wonderful development and resolution of his story, he fills us with constant expectation and carries us beyond our desires.

The most blissful times for art in Greece, and especially in Athens, were the forty years in which Pericles ruled, so to speak, the republic and during the dogged war that preceded the last phase of the Peloponnesian War, which began in the 87th Olympiad. This war is possibly the only one in the history of the world in which art, which is very susceptible, not only suffered no decline but even achieved more than ever before. In this period, the powers in Greece realized themselves fully and completely; and because Athens and Sparta were seeking out and deploying every conceivable means to secure a decisive advantage for one side over the other, every talent manifested itself and all human senses and hands were engaged. Throughout the war, artists looked forward to the great day when their works would be exhibited to every Greek —for all hostilities ceased every four years for the Olympian games and every three years for the Isthmian games, as the warring Greeks came together to general rejoicing at Elis or at Corinth and, at the sight of the bloom of the nation seeking to distinguish themselves, forgot for a few days what had gone before and what was to come. Especially remarkable is an eight-year period during this war that could be regarded as sacred to art: for it is likely that the temples, buildings, and works of art with which Pericles embellished his native land were conceived and executed primarily during this time. The 83rd Olympiad, in which Pheidias flourished, falls within this period as well.

A year later Cimon died, and his death gave Pericles a freer hand to realize his grand ideas. He sought to make riches and abundance prevail in Athens by fully employing all men. He built temples, theaters, aqueducts, and harbors, and in adorning these he verged on profligacy. The Parthenon, the Odeion, and many other buildings, but especially the double wall by which he connected the city to the harbor at Piraeus, are known to all the world. In these years, art began to come to life, as it were, and Pliny the Elder says that bronze sculpture as well as painting now began.

Art before Pheidias cannot rightly be compared to that before Michelangelo and Raphael; but then, as now, it had a simplicity and purity such that the more unaffected and unspoiled it had remained, the more it was amenable to improvement. The two greatest artists in Athens were Pheidias and Parrhasios. In addition to creating his own works of art, the former, in association with Mnesikles, oversaw the great buildings of Pericles; and the latter lent his hand to Pheidias’s work, designing the battle of the Lapiths and the centaurs shown on the shield of Pallas, which was carved by Mys in ivory. This was the golden age of art, in which harmony helped each to work and the publicly recognized and decided merit of each weakened jealousy. Pheidias appears to have completed the statue of the Olympian Jupiter in the 83rd Olympiad, and Pliny probably fixed the period of the artist’s prime in this Olympiad to coincide with the completion of this great work. Pheidias dedicated his art chiefly to the gods and heroes, and at Elis only one among the statues of the victors was by his hand: it represented the beautiful Pantarkes, with whom the artist was enamored, about to tie around his own head the band placed on the brows of the victors in the games. One year before the dedication of the Temple of Pallas, Sophocles produced his Oedipus, the masterpiece of all tragedies. This Olympiad may thus be as remarkable to artists for producing one of the most perfect works of art as it is to scholars.

After the death of Pericles, poetry and art seem not to have met with the same fate as before: particularly as the Athenians were not equal to meeting the costs of the war themselves, little could be spent on works of art. Only drama did not fall out of favor with the people. It was deemed by them to be, as it were, one of the necessities of life. For to a certain extent, they held these performances to be sacred, like the public games, as they too were generally presented at great festivals.

For the reasons given here, one would think that artists would have been scarce during the twenty-eight years that this war lasted. Pericles, their great patron, died in the second or third year of the war; whether Pheidias survived him is unknown. Nevertheless, the first Olympiad in which the Peloponnesian War began is designated as the period in which flourished, in addition to Pheidias, the other great artists: Polykleitos, Myron, Skopas, Pythagoras, and Alkamenes. The greatest and most famous work of Polykleitos was the colossal statue of Juno, made of ivory and gold, at Argos; the noblest in execution were his two statues of young male figures. The one acquired the name Doryphoros, presumably for the spear that it carried; it became the rule for proportion for all later artists, and Lysippos trained himself on it.

Affairs in Greece took another turn in the 100th Olympiad. Epaminondas, the greatest man in all Greece, changed the balance of power among the states, making his native land, Thebes, which seemed negligible before, larger and more powerful than Athens or Sparta. At the same time, fear pressured the latter two cities into an accord; they made peace in the 102nd Olympiad. Peace came to Athens when Epaminondas won his famous victories over the Lacedaemonians at Leuktra and at Mantinea. At this time, the final age of greatness in Greece began: the time of their last heroes and philosophers, their finest writers and greatest orators. Xenophon and Plato were in their prime, and Demosthenes came after them and spoke overpoweringly for his native land. It is in this time — one hundred years after Pheidias — that Praxiteles flourished.

Some time after Praxiteles, there appeared Lysippos, who achieved perfection in his art by pursing the course that the greatest men in their profession have always taken —namely, he sought the source itself and returned to art’s origins to find pure and unadulterated truth. The source and the origin of art is nature itself, which (as in all things, so also here) may be lost under rules, principles, and precepts and can become unrecognizable. What Cicero says — that art is a more correct guide than nature —can from one point of view be considered correct and from another false. Nothing distances an artist more from nature than a system of teachings and a rigid adherence to that system, and this was partly responsible for a certain lingering hardness in most works of art before Lysippos.

Yet the good fortune that still watched over the arts even as they were decimated has preserved for the wonder of all the world a work from this period of art —a testament to the truth of the accounts of the splendor of so many lost masterpieces. Greece suffered more within a short period of time from frequent occupations by hostile armies, almost annual changes of government, and heavy levies that exhausted the nation than it had in all previous domestic wars combined. The Athenians, in whom the spirit of freedom was roused after Alexander’s death, made one last attempt to win independence front Macedonia and encouraged other cities to take up arms against Antipater. But after gaining some advantage, they were defeated and forced to submit to a hard peace. They were compelled to pay, in addition to a large fine, the costs of the war and had also to accept a garrison at the harbor of Munychia. A number of citizens were sent to Thrace, and with this ended the freedom of Athens.

The fall from the blossoming of art is to be taken to refer to artists who newly distinguished themselves: for those who lived on into this period, such as Lysippos, Apelles, and Protogenes, are dated to art’s prime. The great change that took place after Alexander's death is also evident in the language and style of Greek writers, who composed their works from this time forward largely in the so-called common dialect, which at no time or place was the vernacular spoken by the people; it was the language of the learned, just as Latin is now.

The Torso of Herakles appears to be one of the last perfect works that art produced in Greece before its loss of freedom. Abused and mutilated to the extreme, deprived as it is of head, arms, and legs, this statue still appears, to those capable of looking into the mysteries of art, in a blaze of its former beauty. In this Herakles, the artist has figured a high ideal of a body raised above nature and a nature of virile maturity elevated to a state of divine contentment.

Laokoon is a being in the greatest pain, fashioned in the likeness of a man seeking to gather the conscious strength of his mind and spirit against it. As the pain swells his muscles and tenses his nerves, his fortitude of spirit and strength of mind are manifested in the distended brow. The chest strains upward with stifled breath and suppressed waves of feeling, so that the pain is contained and locked within. The fearful groan he draws in and the breath he takes empty the abdomen and hollow out the sides, exposing to our view the movement of his entrails, as it were. Yet his own suffering seems to concern him less than the agony of his children, who turn their faces toward their father and cry out for help. 

The statue of Apollo is the highest ideal of art among all the works of antiquity that have escaped its destruction. The artist has formed this work completely according to the ideal, and he has taken from the material world only as much as was necessary to carry out his intention and make it visible. This Apollo surpasses all other images of him as much as the Apollo of Homer surpasses those portrayed by later poets. His build is elevated above the human, and his stance bears witness to the fullness of his grandeur. An eternal springtime, like that of the blissful Elysian Fields, clothes the alluring virility of mature years with a pleasing youth and plays with soft tenderness upon the lofty structure of his limbs. Go with thy spirit into the realm of incorporeal beauties and seek to become a creator of a heavenly nature, so that the spirit might be filled with beauties that rise above nature — for here there is nothing mortal, nothing that betokens miserable humanity. No veins or sinews heat and move this body, but rather a heavenly spirit that, flowing like a gentle stream, has saturated, as it were, every contour of this figure. He pursued the Python, first using his bow against it, and his mighty stride overtook it and laid it low. His sublime gaze, as if peering into infinity, reaches out from the height of his contentment to far beyond his victory. Scorn sits upon his lips, and the displeasure that he contains within swells the nostrils of his nose and spreads upward to his proud brow. But the tranquility that hovers over him in a blissful stillness remains undisturbed, and his eyes are full of sweetness, as if he were among the Muses as they seek to embrace him. In all the surviving images of him that art holds in esteem, the father of the gods does not approach the greatness in which he manifested himself to the mind of the divine poet, seen here in the countenance of his son, and the individual beauties of the other gods are here mingled together, as they were in Pandora. A brow of Jupiter, gravid with the goddess of wisdom, and eyebrows whose motions declare his will; eyes of the queen of the gods, arched with grandeur, and a mouth whose shape infused desire in the beloved Branchos. His soft hair plays about this divine head like the tender, waving tendrils of the noble grapevine stirred, as it were, by a gentle breeze: it seems anointed with the oil of the gods and bound at the crown of his head with lovely splendor by the Graces. In gazing upon this masterpiece of art, I forget all else, and I myself adopt an elevated stance, in order to be worthy of gazing upon it. My chest seems to expand with veneration and to heave like those I have seen swollen as if by the spirit of prophecy, and I feel myself transported to Delos and to the Lycian groves, places Apollo honored with his presence — for my figure seems to take on life and movement, like Pygmalion’s beauty. How is it possible to paint and describe it! Art herself must advise me and guide my hand to convey henceforth the main features that I have sketched here. I place the concept of this figure that I have conveyed at its feet, like the wreaths offered by those who could not reach the head of the deities whom they wished to crown. 

The head is indisputably one of the most beautiful youthful heads from antiquity. In the face of Apollo, majesty and pride prevail; but here is an image of the grace of lovely youth and the beauty of flourishing years, joined with pleasing innocence and soft allure, without any suggestion of a passion that could disturb the harmony of the parts and the youthful stillness of the soul cultivated here. The entire posture of this noble figure is pervaded by this tranquility and, as it were, by this enjoyment of itself, its senses collected and withdrawn from all external remonstrances. The eye that — as on the goddess of love, but without desire — is moderately curved speaks with captivating innocence; the full mouth in its small extent gathers emotions without appearing to feel them. The cheeks nourished with a lovely fullness define, together with the curved roundness of the gently raised chin, the full and noble contour of the head of this noble youth. The forehead already evinces more than youth, however; it heralds the hero in the lofty magnificence with which it rises, like the forehead of Herakles. 

Had it been possible to return art to its former glory, Hadrian was the man to have done so, as someone lacking neither knowledge nor initiative; but the spirit of freedom had retreated from the world, and the wellspring of elevated thinking and true fame had vanished. The enlightened superstition and Christian teachings that began to disseminate under this emperor may also be identified as a cause. The erudition that Hadrian wanted to promote lost itself in useless little details, and the eloquence that was taught by salaried orators was mostly sophistry. The emperor himself wanted to suppress Homer and advance Antimachos in his place. The style of Greek writers of this period, except for Lucian, is sometimes uneven, sometimes stilted and affected, and is consequently obscure, of which Aristides can serve as an example. For all the freedoms bestowed on them, the Athenians were in such straitened circumstances that they planned to sell some islands that they had formerly retained.

The Sophists, who now occupied the throne, as it were, and for whom the Antonines had public teaching posts set up and a large stipend disbursed for their voices and votes3—these men without any understanding or taste of their own cried out against everything that was not learned, and in their eyes, a skilled artist was the same as a craftsman. Their opinion of art was that which Lucian put into the mouth of Education in his Dream; indeed, young people construed it as a mark of baseness even to wish to become a Pheidias.

Of the works produced under Marcus Aurelius, the one that mostly comes to mind is his own treatise, in which — apart from a sound morality — the ideas as well as the style of writing are common and not really worthy of a prince who occupies himself with writing.

I am referring mainly to sculpture and painting. For as these waned and approached their collapse, architecture flourished to a certain extent, and works were built in Rome whose like in terms of grandeur and splendor had not been seen in Greece during its best time. When few artists could draw a tolerable figure, Caracalla built the astonishing baths whose very ruins still seem marvelous. Diocletian sought to put up baths that surpassed Caracalla’s, and we must admit that their remains can fill us with wonder. The entablatures are smothered by a mass of carvings, however, just as the spectators at the plays of this emperor were overwhelmed by an inundation of flowers, which were thrown at them.

And just as those holy fathers restored the eloquence and the beauty of language again after a great decline, such that they could stand alongside Plato and Demosthenes and by comparison overshadowed all the pagan writers of their time, it would not have been impossible for the same thing to happen in art. Still, art had fallen so far that when statues or heads were decreed and ordered, out of lack of skill and lack of powers of their own, artists took figures by ancient masters and recut them into the person that was to be represented.

Treasures — the likes of which neither time nor the hands of all present or future artists are capable of producing — were destroyed in a wild fury by barbarians in their many assaults on and plunderings of the city, and even by the Romans themselves. The magnificent Temple of Jupiter had already been razed to the ground at the time of Saint Jerome. During the reign of the emperor Justinian, in 537, the forces of Theodafhad, king of the Goths, under the command of Vitiges, laid siege to Rome, and when the Mole of Hadrian was stormed, the besieged defended themselves by hurling statues down on the enemy. The celebrated sleeping faun in the Barberini gallery was probably among these statues, for it was found — lacking thighs and legs, and without the left arm — when the ditch surrounding this fortress was cleared in Pope Urban VIII’s time, together with the bronze statue of Septimius Severus.

I have in this history of art already gone beyond its set bounds, and although contemplating the collapse of art has driven me nearly to despair, still, like someone who, in writing the history of his native land, must touch upon the destruction that he himself has witnessed, I could not keep myself from gazing after the fate of works of art as far as my eye could see. Just as a beloved stands on the seashore and follows with tearful eyes her departing sweetheart, with no hope of seeing him again, and believes she can glimpse even in the distant sail the image of her lover — so we, like the lover, have as it were only a shadowy outline of the subject of our desires remaining. But this arouses so much the greater longing for what is lost, and we examine the copies we have with greater attention than we would if we were in full possession of the originals. In this, we often are like individuals who wish to converse with spirits and believe they can see something where nothing exists. The word antiquity has become a prejudgment, but even this bias is not without its uses. One always imagines that there is much to find, so one searches much to catch sight of something.
