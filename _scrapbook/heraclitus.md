# Heraclitus

### Preface

(Note-to-self: Gather the remaining materials incl. Nietzsche Oxford, Pages, Heidegger, 50, War) 

"The longing not to die, the hunger for personal immortality, the effort by which we strive to persevere in our own being, this is the emotional basis for all knowledge and the intimate point of departure for all human philosophy."

It is necessary to bear in mind that scientific culture was something rather new in Heraclitus' day and restricted to a small circle of initiates. For the most part the dominant culture is the culture of Homer, the poets and the early sages. The underlying assumption common to both traditions is a basic antithesis between gods and men, between the divine and the human, and an interpretation of the human condition in light of this contrast. Human nature is characterized by mortality and fallibility: by the brevity of human life and by the weakness of our intellectual vision. 

The latter conception of divinity as birthless and not merely deathless, as radically different from men in every respect, is essentially the conception of a cosmic god: a deity conceived not as the supreme patriarch of a quasi human family but as the ruliing principle of an orderly universe. 

In the early tradition, the Homeric [iliad] conception of arete [paideia] is strikingly expressed in a few verses: 'Always be first and best, and ahead of everyone else.' The unabashed striving for individual pre-eminence, in the spirit of an athletic competition or on the battlefield, is specified for the Homeric hero by two ranges of activity in which he may achieve distinction: 'to be a speaker of words and a doer of deeds'. The deeds are those of military and athletic prowess; the words are those of wise counsel and planning. This ancient duality of speech and action remains as a permanent paradigm for the classification of achievements: it is echoed in Heraclitus' opening reference to the 'words and works which I set forth', as in the later sophistic antithesis between in words and in deed. Questions of cognition are inseparable from questions of action and intention, questions of life and death. We find in the early heroic code no recognition of intellectual or moral excellence that might be distinct in principle from the successful pursuit of whatever goals one has in view. With some oversimplificatoin, we can say that according to the heroic code, an action is judged wrong shameful or foolish only if and because it will lead to failure and disaster for the agent himself. The oversimplification here lies in two respects: first the sucess or failure of an agent is inseparable from the fortunes of ones family - heroic individualism is inseparable from blood, biological excellence is predeterminative of actional excellence. Second: the heroic code recognizes independent standards of behavior that one may rightly be punished for disobeying - a violation of a code whose rules cannot be defined exclusively in terms of success or failure in the heroic competition for arete for a given individual. The concept of arete should allign for both the self and the social, with the whole of nature. Sophrosyne has the meaning of good sense, soundness of mind, the ability to take rational action in pursuit of ones interest - in later usage this term comes to denote action and speech that is socially esteemed, to be met with approval from ones fellow men and also from the gods, a decent sense of ones place within a social setting and one's limitations as a human being. This comes to be the watchword for the rather un-Homeric conception of excellence summed up as 'Know thyself'. Both views, the selfish and the social conception of arete and the deep tension between the two were in the bloodstream of the Greeks long before philosophy appeared on the scene. Heraclitus articulates a view within which the opposites can be seen together as a unity, there should be no conflict between the selfish and social conception of arete, since the deepest structure of the self will be recognnized as co-extensive with the universe in general and the political community in particular. 'Men may live as if they had a private world of thinking and planning, but the logos of the world order, like the law of the city, is common to all.' So true self knowledge will coincide with knowledge of the cosmic order, and true self assertion will mean holding fast to what is shared by all. The best of men, including those whon die in battle for defence of their city, choose everlasting glory as did the Homeric hero, but they choose not their own interest in a private sense but what is common and shared to all, which represents the divine unity of the cosmos. For Heraclitus there should be no split between nomos and nature, as an institution law is neither man-made nor conventional: it is the expression in social terms of the cosmic order for which another name is justice. Heraclitus generalizes the notion of justice to apply to every manifestation of cosmic order, including the rule of the jungle by which birds and beasts eat one another and human law is conceived as the unifying principle of the political community and thus as grounded in the rational order of nature which unifies the cosmos. 

(Note-to-self: After planning there should be a link to 50)

The Anaximanderian notions of cosmic order as one of opposition, reciprocity, inevitable justice, patterns of physical changes and transformations, the birth of what is new and the death of what is old, is seen as a conflict regulated by the ordinance of time, where the contestants appear in turn as victor and vanquished. This ordering, described in the language of justice, where the wrongdoer must pay the penalty for his aggression or excess, is taken over by Heraclitus, with all its poetic resonance and association with older mythical ideas: 'War is shared for the killer will be killed in his turn and hence conflict is justice' 

The new Ionian cosmology has four fundamental features: (1) a geometric model for the heavens, (2) observation and numerical measurement of astral cycles, (3) the interpretation of physical change as a conflict of elemental powers within a periodic order of reciprocity and syymetry recognized as just, (4) the tendency to explain the present state of affairs by deriving it from some initial situation or first beginning. These four principles characterize the original Greek conception of the natural world as a kosmos, an orderly arrangement whose structure can be rationallly understood. For the early cosmologists we can add a fifth principle: the idea of a cosmic god. If Heraclitus shows little interest in the geometry of the heavens of scientific explanation for nature in detail, his thought is nevertheless penetrated by the new conception of the cosmos - his system can be understood as a response to the Milesian physicists. Responding to Thales and Anaximander, Heraclitus chooses fire as the starting point of all things, however, such a grouping is inadequate since Heraclitus' fire is not merely a physical theory, ignoring the poetic nature of his statements. The doctines of fire, cosmic order, and elemental transformations serve as more than illustartions of the identity of structure between the inner perosnal world of the psyche and the larger natural order of the universe; they reveal a general truth about the unity of opposites, a truth whose primary application to human understanding lies in a deeper understanding of their own experience: a meditation on human life and human destiny in the context of biological death. In Heraclitus' view, an understanidng of the human condition is inseparable from an insight into the unifying structure of the universe, the total unity within which all opposing principles - including mortality and immortality - are reconciled. It is this insight which Heraclitus prizes as wisdom. The war of opposites, the cosmic fire, the divine one which is also wisdom itself or the wise one - all these provide the framework within which human life and death are to be understood, and to be understood means to be seen in their unity, like day and night. The ignorance of men lies in their failure to comprehend the logos in which this is articulated, the logos which is at once the discourse of Heraclitus, the nature of language itself, the structure of the psyche and the universal principle in accordance with all things come to pass. The pattern of human life and the cosmic order is one and the same. 

Heraclitus accepts the Milesian view of a world order in which the opposition and transformation of elementary powers is governed by measure and proportion. But he denies that this order is imposed upon the world by any power from without. Instead, he deifies one of its internal constituents. For to say that fire is 'everliving', that it 'ever was and is and will be' is to say, simply, that it is eternal and divine. Yet Heraclitus insists upon the fact that this god participates in the changing life of nature, 'kindled in measures and in measures going out'. What is striking about Heraclitus' statement is that it confronts us with the double paradox of a world order identified with one of its constituent parts, and an eternal principle embodied in the most transitory of visual phenomena. Heraclitus' aim is not to improve the Milesian cosmology by altering a particular doctrine but to reinterpret its total meaning by a radical shift in perspective. The advantage of fire for the new point of view is that it signifies both a power of destruction and death — as in a burning city or a funeral pyre — and also a principle of superhuman vitality; a temporary phenomenon that dies out or is quenched and an eternal principle that is everywhere one and the same, whether in the altar flame, the domestic hearth, the forest fire lit by lightning, or the blazing torches of war. By meditating on the fire one who knows how to read oracular signs can perceive the hidden harmony that unifies opposing principles not only within the cosmic order but also in the destiny of the human psyche. Mortals are immortal, immortals mortal. The opposites are one; and this deathless structure of life and death is deity itself. 

### The Fragments 

(Note-to-self: I need to arrange these fragments in order as well as add interlinkings to this page and add greater depth and breadth - think volatility as such example).

1. Although this logos holds always humans prove unable to understand it both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For although all things come to be in accordance with this logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each thing in accordance with its nature (physis) and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.

2. Not comprehending, they hear like the deaf. The saying bears witness to them, absent while present.

3. Although the logos is shared, most men live as though their thinking were a private possession. 

4. Most men do not think things in the way that they encounter them, nor do they recognize what they experience, but believe their own opinions. 

5. Nature loves to hide. 

6. Let us not concur casually about the most important matters. 

7. Eyes and ears are poor witnesses for men if they have barbarian souls. 

8. Much learning does not teach understanding. For it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and also Xenophanes and Hecataeus. 

9. Of all those whose logoi I have heard, none has got so far as this: to recognize what is wise, set apart from all. 

10. It belongs to all men to know theselves and think well.

11. Thinking well is the greatest excellence and wisdom: to act and speak what is true, perceiving things according to their nature. 

To act what is true. The solution I propose is to give alethes 'true' its etymological value: 'not concealed', 'not hidden in one's heart'. Soundness of thinking will then mean to speak and act the true in the sense of communicating the logos in 'words and deeds', sharing with others one's perception of how things hang together in unity and are also distinguished in their own nature (physis). The man whose thinking is sound will not hide the truth but signify it in his actions as in his words. In this he will imitate the lord of Delphi, who does not hide the truth but shows it with a sign, and whose lesson to mankind is sophronein.

12. The lord whose oracle is in Delphi neither declares nor conceals but gives a sign. 

13. You will not find out the limits of the soul by going, even if you travel over every way, so deep is its logos. 

- It is wise, listening not to me but to the logos, to agree that all things are one. 

- The kosmos, the same for all, no god nor man has made, but it ever was and is and will be: fire everliving, kindled in measures and in measures going out. 

- All things are requital for fire, and fire for all things, as goods for gold and gold for goods. 

- The sun will not transgress his measures. If he does, the Furies, ministers of justice, will find him out. 

- As they step into the same rivers, other and still other waters flow upon them.

- Changing, it rests. 

- The most beautiful of apes is ugly in comparison with the race of men; the wisest of men seems an ape in comparison to a god, both in wisdom and beauty and in all the rest.

- Human opinions are toys for children. 

- What wit or understanding do they have? They believe the poets of the people and take the mob as their teacher, not knowing that the many are worthless; good men are few. 

- Dogs bark at those they do not recognize. 

- One man is ten thousand if he is best. 

- What the Ephesians deserve is to be hanged to the last man, every one of them, and leave the city to the boys, since they drove out their best man, Hermodorus, saying 'Let no one be the best among us; if he is, let him be so elsewhere and among others.'

- The people must fight for the law as for their city wall.

- It is law also to obey the counsel of one. 

- It is not better for human beings to get all they want. It is disease that has made health sweet and good, hunger satiety, weariness rest. 

- For god all things are fair and good and just, but men have talen some things as unjust, others as just. 

- If it were not for these things, they would not have known the name of justice. 

- The sea is the purest and foulest water: for fishes drinkable and life-sustaining; for men undrinkable and deadly. 

- Even the potion separates unless it is stirred.

- Asses prefer garbage to gold. 

- All beasts are driven by blows.

- Doctors who cut and burn and torture their patients in every way complain that they do not receive the reward they deserve from the patients, acting as they do. 

- The path of the carding wheel is straight and crooked. 

- The counter-thrust brings together and from tones at variance comes the finest attunement, and all things come to pass through conflict. 

- They do not comprehend how a thing at variance with itself: an attunement turning back on itself, like that of the bow and the lyre. 

- The name of the bow is life; its work is death.

- The hidden attunement is better than the obvious one. 

- 'Would that conflict might vanish from among gods and men!' For there would be no harmony without high and low notes nor any animals without male and female, both of which are opposites. The nature of things are constructed according to conflict, without which one prays for the destruction of the kosmos. 

- One must realize that war is shared and conflict is justice, and that all things come to pass in accordance with conflict. 

- War is the father of all and king of all; and some he has shown as gods, others men; some he has made slaves, others free. 

- Justice will catch up with those who invent lies and those who swear to them.

- The great man is eminent in imagining things, and on this he hangs his reputation. 

- Death is all things we see awake; all we see asleep is sleep. 

- A man strikes a light for himself in the night, when his sight is quenched. Living, he touches the dead in his sleep; waking he touches the sleeper. 

- Immortals mortal, mortals immortal, living the others' death, dead in the others life.

The thought is: 'we mortal men are immortal in that our death is really a new kind of (divine) life; they, the gods, are mortal not because they die but because their life is derived from our death'.

To this natural objection I believe the true Heraclitean response will be: 'You have entirely misunderstood my doctrine. Yes, I do reduce all sorts of change and survival to one type, but it is to the second and not to the third: to likeness of kind and identity of structure, which the river illustrates by preserving its form while all the individuating matter has been replaced: the river as a concrete individual is ever dying and being reborn, as "other and again other waters" are ever pouring in. And this identity of pattern holds generally for nature as a whole: it includes the constant structure of the year, within which the seasons change, as well as the constant unit of the night-and-day, within which the relative length of the night and of the day will vary according to the seasons. So even if Anaximander or some other theorist was right to suppose that the formation of the world will be balanced in time by its destruction, so that the ruling principle of fire will eventually consume all things in a regular exchange between itself as fire and itself as cosmos, even so the unity of the whole pattern will be preserved, within which all the parts must change and recur with likeness of kind. In short, the only identical individual is the cosmic process as a whole, with its cycle of recurrence over the longest year, whatever time and pattern this cycle of transformations may take; but its unity of structure is guaranteed by the regular recurrence of the same forms, by likeness of kind, as defined by the permanent tension and rhythmic alternation between opposites at every level: from individual birth and death to the daily lighting and quenching of the sun; from the birth and death of the elements to the eternal kindling and extinction of cosmic fire. This is the sense of personal identity and personal survival which I have come to recognize: the unity of all things in the wise one alone, which I found when I set out in search of myself.'

- Lifetime is a child at play, moving pieces in a game. Kingship belongs to the child

- Greater deaths are alloted greater destinies.  

- Gods and men honor those who are slain by Ares. 

- The best choose one thing in exchange for all, everflowing fame among mortals; but most men have sated themselves like cattle. 

- To the soul belongs a logos that increases itself. 

- The way up and down is one and the same. 

- One must quench hybris quicker than a blazing fire. 

- It is hard to fight against passion; for whatever it wants it buys at the expense of the soul. 

- A gleam of light is the dry soul, wisest and best. 

But the poetic associations of the word connect it with the light of the sun as a figure for life itself, as in the Homeric phrase 'to see the rays of the sun', meaning 'to be alive'. The radiance of the sunlit sky thus stands traditionally for life; it is the innovation of Heraclitus to identify this physically with the finest state of the psyche.

If there is a kernel of truth in this report, it indicates that the matter of the best and wisest souls must itself constitute the effulgence of the heavenly bodies, or their celestial source and environment.

They recognize, in choosing the gleam of light that is the 'ever-renewed glory of mortals', both the fire exchanged for all things and 'the wise one alone': the wisdom that governs the universe and the sun that never sets.

And Heraclitus would surely have answered like Spinoza: the beatitude which rewards a life of excellence is the quality of that life itself; in his own words 'man's character is his fate', his daimon for good fortune or for bad.

This universal structure of living-through-dying, the deep logos of the soul which makes it (in one sense) co-extensive with the cosmos, is the very logos according to which 'all things come to pass', that is, according to which 'all things are born'.

Action to what is shared by all, to this extent the psyche can 'travel over every path without limit and can come to realize its unity with the cosmos as a whole, in the everliving fire forever kindled and forever put out. 

- Man's character is his fate. 

- The mysteries current among men initiate them into impiety. 

A man cuts down a tree, half of it he burns in the fire and warms himself, 'and the rest of it he makes into a god'; he falls down before it and 'prays to it and says "Deliver me, for thou art my god!"'.

- The wise is one alone, unwilling and willing to be spoken of by the name of Zeus. 

- The thunderbolt pilots all things. 

- Fire coming on will discern and catch up with all things. 

- How can one hide from that which never sets. 

- The god: day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, satiety and hunger. It alters, as when mingled with perfumes it gets named according to the pleasure of each one. 

- Graspings: wholes and not wholes, convergent divergent, consonant dissonant, from all things one and from one thing all. 

- The fairest order in the world, the most beautiful kosmos, is a heap of random sweepings. 

They are at odds with the logos, with which above all they are in continuous contact, and the things they meet every day appear strange to them. 

The sun is new each day
