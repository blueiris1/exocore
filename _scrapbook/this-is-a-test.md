-  [Markov Blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_blanket)
-  [Model of Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_reasoned_action)

## Classical model of action:
- Optimal action depends on state of the world 
- Therefore, first step of action is to (1) form a belief (analyse surroundings/prospects)
- (2) imagine a value function of next state brought about by action
- (3) optimise action that maximises value of the next state
