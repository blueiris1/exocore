# The Ideals of Greek Culture

## Nobility and Arete 

The training of the young must be distinguished from cultural education, which aims at fulfilling an ideal of man as he ought to be. In such an ideal pattern, utility is neglected, or at least relegated to the background. The vital factor is the Beautiful as a determinant ideal. The aristocratic origin of the kalos kagathos in classical Greece is as clear as that of the gentlemen of England. Both titles carry us back to the ideal of knightly aristocracy. It is a fundamental fact in the history of culture that all higher civilisation springs from the differentiation of social classes - a differentiation which is created by natural variations in physical and mental capacity between man and man. The nobility is the prime mover in forming a nation's culture. The history of Greek culture - that universally imprtant aspect of the formation of the Greek national character - actually begins in the aristocratic world of early Greece, with the creation of a definite ideal of human perfection, an ideal towards which the elite of the race was contantly trained. Since our earliest literary evidence shows us an aristocratic civilisation rising above the mass of the common people, we must start our historical survey with a sketch of that civilisation. All later culture, however high an intellectual level it may reach, and however greatly its content may change, still bears the imprint of its aristocratic origin. Culture is simply the aristocratic ideal of a nation, increasingly intellectualized. 

We can find a more natural clue to the history of Greek culture in the history of the idea of arete, which goes back to the earliest times. Its oldest meaning is a combination of proud and courtly morality with warlike valour. The idea of arete is the quintessence of early Greek aristocratic education. The aristocracies of early Greece are first described by Homer, where we find both the historical evidence for the life of that epoch and the permanent poetic expression of its ideals. We follow the history of the culture by fixing our attention on the historical development and at the same time on the artistic struggle to perpetuate the ideal which is the highest creative expression of every epoch. 

Arete is the real attribute of the nobleman. The Greeks always believed that surpassing strength and prowess were the natural basis for leadership: it was impossible to dissociate leadership and arete. The root of the word is the same as that of aristos, the word which shows superlative ability and superiority, which was constantly used in the plural to denote the nobility. 

Heroic valor is not considered as a moral quality distinct from strength, it is always closely bound up with physical power. But arete does not have such a narrow meaning. The Odyssey constantly exalts intellectual ability, especially in its hero, whose courage is ranked lower than his cleverness and cunning. It was natural that in the warlike age of the great migrations men should be valued chiefly for their prowess in battle. Both meanings were derived from the same root: both denote the gentlemen who posseses, both in war and in private life, standards which are not valid for the common people. In Homer, the real mark of the nobleman is his sense of duty. The nobleman's pride in high race and achievement is partnered by his high knowlegde that his preeminence can be guaranteed only by the virtues which won it. In peace time too, the warriors match the aretai against one another in war-games: in the Iliad we see them in competition even in a brief pause in the war, at the funeral games of Patroclus. 

(Note-to-self: Quote and the code of the nobility had an influence on the polis.)

There is another way in which the Iliad bears witness to the high educational ideals of the early Greek aristocracy. It shows that the old conception of arete as warlike prowess could not satisfy the poets of the new age: their new ideal of human perfection was that charcater which united nobility of action with nobility of mind. The Homeric man estimated his worth exclusively by the standards of the society to which we belonged. He was a creature of his class: he measured his won arete by the opinion which others held of him. When the Homeric man does a great deed, he never hesitates to claim the honor which fits his reward. The conscience of a Greek was entirely public. Such ambition was to be the aspiration of the individual towards that ideal and supra-personal sphere in which alone he can have real value. The gods themselves claim their due honor. They jealously avenge any infringement of it, and pride themsleves on the praise which their worshippers give to their deeds. Homer's gods are an immortal aristocracy. And the essence of Greek worship and piety lay in giving honor to the godhead: to be pious is to honor the divinity, to honor both gods and men for their arete is a primitive instict. Human effort after complete arete is the product of an ennobled self love. The self is not the physical self but the ideal which inspires us, the ideal which every nobleman strives to realise in his own life. If we grasp that, we shall see that it is the highest kind of self love which makes man reach out towards the highest arete through which he takes possession of the beautiful. This is the very heart of the Greek view of life - the sense of heroism through which we can feel them most closely akin to ourselves. By this clue we can understand the whole of Hellenic history - the psychological explanation of the short but glorious aristeia of the Greek spirit. The basic motive of arete is contained in these words 'to take possession of the beautiful'. The courage of a Homeric nobleman is superior to avmad berserk contempt of death in this that he subordinates his physical self to the demands of a higher aim, the beautiful. And so the man who gives up his life to win the beautiful, will find that his natural instinct for self-assertion finds its highest expression in self-sacrifice.

## The Culture and Education of the Homeric Nobility

In the older epic we see a world at war: and war, we must assume, was incessant during the great wandering of the Greek peoples. The Iliad tells of an age wholly dominated by the ancient hero-spirit of arete; and it embodies the ideal of arete in each of its heroes. Throughout the poem, the brave man is the nobleman, the man of rank. Battle and victory are his highest distinction; they are the real meaning of his life. The Odyssey presents a different picture, the existence of the heroes after war, their adventurous voyages and their home-life among their families and friends, it is inspired by the life of aristocracies of its own day, projected with a naive realism into a more primitive epoch. It is our chief piece of evidence for the nature of early Greek aristocratic civilisation. The community of Ithaca is governed, in the absence of its king, by a popular assembly under the leadership of the noblemen; and the city of the Phaeacians is a faithful likeness of an Ionian city ruled by a king. In the Odyssey, the aristocracy is an exclusive caste with a strong consciousness of its privileges, its commanding power, and its refinement of life and behaviour. 

The poet loves the men and women whom he portrays: we can see in every line that he admires their culture and high refinement. It is certain that he had an educational purpose in exalting them. He presents the courtesy of his heroes as an absolute value; not as an unimportant background to their life, but as a real factor in their superiority. The forms and formalities of their life are inseparable from their conduct. 

The presuppositions of aristocratic civilisation are fixed residence in one place, ownership of land, and respect for tradition. These are the factors which allow a set form of life to be transmitted unaltered from one generation to another. But to them we must add good breeding - a conscious education of the younf towards the aristocratic ideal, under the severe discipline of courtly manners and morals. Aristocracy, in all ages and all nations, is marked by discipline, the deliiberate formation of human character through wise direction and constant advice. the superior rank and worth of the aristocracy imply an obligation to shape its members during their malleable youth into the accepted ideal of nobility. In this process education becomes culture for the first time: that is, it becomes a process by which the whole personality is modelled on a fixed pattern. 

A word on the educational influence of women in this civilisation. The real arete of woman is beauty - naturally enough: men are valued by their intellectual and physical excellence. The cult of feminine beauty in Greece during this period corresponds to the courtly refinement of every knightly age. However, woman is not only the goal and ideal of admiration (like Helen and Penelope); she also has a constant social and legal status as mistress of the household, and as such her virtues are sober morality and domestic prudence. Penelope is highly praised for her wisdom, her chastoty and her good housekeeping; Helen for her beauty and social elegance, she is the pattern of all great ladies. Finally, the intimate relationship of the hero to his divine companion and friend, Pallas Athena, is a most beautiful expression of the feminine power of inspiration and guidance throughout the trials of the world.

(Note-to-self: Link Homeric gods above and include appropriate links elsewhere when I find out how to do it nicely.)

In investigating the state of culture among the Homeric aristocracy, we need not depend entirely on the evidence offered by occasional descriptions of courtly manners and morals; the epics also contain avivid description of the education of young noblemen. The tutor of the heroes par excellence is the wise centaur Chiron, who lived among the wooded glens of Mount Pelion in Thessaly. [. . .] Ajax embodies the element of action in Phoenix's educational ideal, and Odysseus the element of speech. Achilles alone unites both these elements: he fulfils the true harmony of the highest powers of both body and mind. This passage more than any other in the Iliad justifies Plato's description of Homer as the teacher and guide of tragic poets. The whole idea is of the greatest importance to the history of Greek education. It shows the regular pattern, the underlying ideal of aristocratic training. When Achilles has no experience of either war or the art of aratory, his father Peleus sens his most trusty vassal to be his companion on the battlefield and at court, and to mould him after the traditional pattern of manliness. 

This vivid and concrete presentation of the unequal struggle between good and evil spirits to win the human heart expresses that internal conflict between blind passion and higher insight which is the truest and deepest problem of all education. Here we must not introduce the modern ideas of free-will, choice, and guilt. The ancient conception is far wider and far more tragic. We see in fact that the cheerfully practical educational ideas of the old aristocracy are even in the Iliad already merging into a grave consciousness of the limitations of every type of education. The core of the Odyssey is the problem of converting the young son of Odysseus into a thoughtful man whose high purposes shall be crowned with noble achievement. It is impossible to read the Odyssey without feeling its deliiberately educational outlook as a whole, although many parts of the poem show no trace of it. The character of Telemachus in the first four books of the Odyssey is presented as to serve a deliberate educational end; his divine inspiration comes to him in a natural and lifelike manner, in the form of a deliberate influence upon his will and intellect, a conscious schooling of the young mans spirit; after that schooling nothing more is needed but the decisive external impulse to give him readiness and initiative for his task. In every great educational ideal which the Greeks conceived and fulfilled, we see their full consciousness of that divine imponderable most clearly in the two great aristocrats Pindar and Plato. 

We must pay close attention to one point which is specifically important in any discussion of the intellectual principles of aristocratic culture and that is the role of example in education. The repetition of Homer considers that the appeal to the example of famous geroes and traditional instances is an integral part of all aristocratic ethics and education. But the later Greeks also held to the paradeigma, the example for immitation, as a fundamental category in life and thought. We need only think of Pindar's use of mythological examples, which are such an essential element of his triumphant hymns. Not merely a stylistic trick, it is part of the very essence of old aristocratic ethics; and its educational importance still affects its use in early poetry. Plato's whole philosophy is built on the conception of pattern, and that he describes the Ideas as 'patterns established in the realm of being', we can easily see the origin of this category. The idea of the good, that universally applicable pattern, is directly descended from the models of heroic arete which were part of the old aristocratic code. Between the educational ideals of the primitive age and Pindar and Plato's philosophy we can see an unbroken organic necessary line of development. It is not evolution in the half scientific sense which historians often use; it is a gradual unfolding of the essential elements iin the earliest from of that Greek spirit which throughout all variations of its history remains fundamentally one and the same. 

## Homer the Educator 

Plato's passionate philosophical criticism of the poets succeeded ins howing that the edicational influence of poetry was far less wide than men had believed; but all his attacks did not shake the supremacy of Homer. The Greeks always felt that a poet was in the broadest and deepest sense the educator of his people. Homer was only the noblest example, as it were the classic instance, of that general conception. We should be wrong not to take it seriously, to limit our understanding of Greek poetry by substituting for that ideal the modern belief in art for art's sake. That belief, although it characterizes certain types and periods of poetry and the fine arts, does not appear in the great Greek poets. We cannot therefore apply it to the study of Greek poetry. In early Greek thought there was no separation between ethics and aesthetics: the distinction was comparatively late in arising.

Plato himself held that the value of Homer's poetry was immediately diminished by a proof that it did not tell the truth."The idea that poetry is not useful to life first appears among the ancient theorists of poetics; and it was the Christians who finally taught men to appraise poetry by apurely aesthetic standard —a standard which enabled them to reject most of the moral and religious teachings of the classical poets as false and ungodly, while accepting the formal elements in their work as instructive and aesthetically delightful. Many poets since then have conjured up the gods and heroes of pagan mythology; but now we think of them merely as the shadowy puppets of poetic fancy. We might easily regard Homer from the same narrow point of view; but if we did, we should never come to understand what myth and poetry really meant to the Greeks. We are naturally repelled when the philosophical critics of the Hellnistic age sum up Homer's educational influence in a bald rationalist fabula docet - this scholastic idea is only a degenerate form of a real truth, like all beauty and truth, passing through coarse hands. Homer, like all the great Greek poets is something much more than a figure in the parade of literary history. He is the first and the greatest creator and shaper of Greek life and character. Poetry can educate only when it expresses all the aesthetic and moral potentialities of mankind, and the educational content and the aristic form affect each other reciprocally and spring from the same root. Poetry cannot be educative unless it is rooted in the depths of the human soul, unless it embodies a moral belief, a high ardour of the spirit, a broad and compelling ideal of humanity. And the greatest of Greek poetry does more tham show a cross-section of life taken at random. It tells the truth; but it chooses and presents its truth in accordance with a definite ideal. On the other hand, it is usually through artistic expression that the highest values acquire permanent significance and the force which moves mankind. Art has a limitless power of converting the human soul - a power which the Greeks called psychagogia. For art alone possesses the two essentails of eduactional influence - universal significance and immediate appeal. Poetry is more philosophical than life and more lifelike than philosophy. These observations are far from being applicble to the poetry of all ages - they do not even apply to the whole of Greek poetry, although their significance is not confined to Greek poetry alone. Through the art of Homer, the ideas of teh Homeric age have achieved a far greater permanence and universality, and thereby a wider and more lasting cultural influence than those of any other epoch. the Greek epics express, with an incomparable depth and fulness, the eternal knowledge of truth and destiny which is the creation of the heroic age-the age that cannot be destroyed by any bourgeois 'progress'. Greece had a unique power of discerning and reproducing the elements in human life which are real and all embracing: for Homer, whostands on the threshold of Greek history, became the teacher of all humanity.

In that aristocracy, with its lofty traditions and exacting standards, the Homeric epic found an expression of the higher life of the spirit; and through that life the epics themselves live and move. The spiritual lifeblood of the Iliad is the pathos and the heroic doom of man's struggle; the Odyssey is inspired by human character, shown in aristocratic culture and morality. The society which produced that life was itself to die, leaving no trace in history; but its portrait, worked out by the art of Homer, remained to be the ideal basis of all Hellenic culture. Hölderlin has said, 'That which endures is the work of the poet', and his words express the law governing the history of Greek education.

The Homeric epics are a vast and complex work of the spirit, which cannot be assessed by one single formula: they contain, besides those comparatively late sections which show a frank interest in education, passages of an entirely different nature, passages in which the poet's eye is fastened so firmly upon the object he is describing that we can admit no thought of an underlying ethical purpose. We must distinguish these deliberately educational passages from what may be called objective education: that is, from educational effects which are not envisaged by the poet himself, but are implicit in the very nature of epic poetry. Consideration of these effects will lead us back to the very beginnings of the epic. Plato counts poetic ecstasy as one of the beautiful effects of divine madness, and thus describes the poet's rapture: 'Possession by the Muses, and their madness, invade a gentle and chaste soul, awaken it, and bewitch it with songs and all kinds of poesy; and, by glorifying countless deeds of men of old, educate posterity.' This is the original Hellenic ideal of poetry. Myth and heroic poetry are the nation's inexhaustible treasure of great examples: from them it derives its ideals and its standards for daily life. The characters appeal to the myth as a collection of authoritative instances. That is how we must interpret the close connexion of poetry and myth, which is an invariable law throughout Greek literary history. It arises from the origin of poetry in the heroic ballad, from the ideal of glory, of the praise and imitation of great heroes. The law does not hold beyond the sphere of high poetry, but the epic is a wholly ideal world; and myth, for the early Greeks, was the supreme idealizing factor. And the epic style, with its exalting, ennobling, and transfiguring power, affects more than the use of epithets: the same nobility appears in the epic descriptions and portraits. Everything low, contemptible, and ugly is banished from the world of the epic. 'Homer praised almost everything-animals and plants, water and earth, weapons and horses. He passed over nothing without somehow honouring and glorifying it. Even the one man whom he abused, Thersites, he called a clear-voiced speaker.' 

(Note-to-self: Top down, beautiful, aristocrats.)

Epic poetry, then, is distinguished by its idealizing tendency (which is connected with its origin in the old heroic lays) from all other literary types; and from that tendency it derives its predominant place in the history of Greek education. The original patterns from which the later poetic genera developed can be divided into those which concerned the worship of the gods, those which concerned private life, and those which concerned the life of the community. Those types of poetry which sprang from private life or religious usages have, to begin with, little to do with education. Heroic poetry, on the other hand, aims naturally at the creation and perpetuation of a heroic ideal. Its educational aim and influence are far greater than that of all other types of poetry, because it gives an objective picture of life as a whole, and portrays men at hand-grips with destiny, struggling to win a noble prize. Didactic and elegiac poetry, which followed the path marked out by epic, both resemble it closely in their form. From it they inherited the educational spirit, which later passed to still other types, iambic and choral poetry. Tragedy, too, owes both its traditional material and its ethical and educational spirit to epic, not to its own Dionysiac origin. And if we consider that the types of prose literature which have the greatest educational influence-such as history and the philosophical treatise were created by a conflict of ideas with the philosophic assumptions of epic poetry, we may feel justified in asserting that the epic is the root of all higher Greek culture. The epic is not only an immense advance in the art of constructing a unified poem of great scope and extreme complexity; it also contains a new and deeper view of life and its problems, a greater intensity of contemplation which raises heroic poetry far above its original sphere and gives the poet a new position as an educator in the highest sense. The work of Homer is throughout inspired by a comprehensive philosophy of human nature and of the eternal laws of the world-process, a philosophy which has seen and judged every essential factor in man's life. He contemplates every event and every character in the light of his universal knowledge of the underlying and eternal truth. 

That deep sense of the harmony between man and nature, which inspires the description of Achilles' shield, is dominant in Homer's conception of the world. One great rhythm penetrates the moving whole. No day is so full of human striving that the poet forgets to tell how the sun rises and sinks above the turmoil, how the toil and battle of the day is succeeded by repose, and how the night, which loosens men's limbs ni sleep, embraces all mortals. Homer is neither a naturalist nor a moralist. He is not sandipt away wit out fort dni hte shore. ays af lind spiritual forces are equally real for him. He has a keen and ob- jective insight into human passions. He knows their elemental violence, which overpowers man himself and whirls him away in their grip. But though that force may often seem to overswell its banks, it is always controlled by strong barriers beyond. For Homer, and for the Greeks in general, the ultimate ethical boundaries are not mere rules of moral obligation, but fundamental laws of Beings. It is to this sense of ultimate reality, this deeper knowledge of the meaning of the world, beside which all mere 'realism' seems thin and partial, that the Homeric epic owes its overpowering effect. Homer sees life as governed by universal laws; and for that reason he is a supreme artist in the craft of motivation. He does not passively accept tradition: he does not relate a simple succession of events; he does not, like modern authors, see every action from eithin, as a phenomena of human consciousness. In his world, nothing great happens without the aid of a divine power. The psychological and the metaphysical aspects of any event are not mutually exclusive: on the contrary, Homer holds them to be complementary. If we think of the mediaeval Christian epics written in German and in the Romance languages, and remember how they introduce no gods into their plots, and therefore present every action from the subjective side alone, as a simple human activity, we shall realize their vast distance from the deep poetic sense of reality which inspires the work of Homer. The fact that he holds the gods to be implicated in every human action and suffering obliges the Greek poet to see the eternal meaning of all man's acts and destinies, to find them their place in a general scheme of the world, and to measure them by the loftiest religious and moral standards. 

The Odyssey shows this characteristic of epic construction even more strongly than the Iliad. It is the work of an age which has systematized and rationalized its beliefs; at least the poem as we have it was completed in such an age and bears its clear imprint. When two nations are at war, and call on their gods, with prayer and sacrifice, for help, the gods are placed in a difficult situation — that is, if their worshippers believe in their omnipotence and impartiality. Thus we can trace in the Iliad, with its comparatively advanced moral and religious beliefs, a struggle to harmonize the ideal of one indivisible and intelligent divine power with the original conception of most of the gods as local and specialized divinities. The Greek deities were very human and very near to mankind. Their human traits led the Greek nobles (proudly conscious of their own divine descent) to imagine that the life and activity of the heavenly powers were not unlike their own life on earth.

Ultimately, it is the Greek spirit, with its native passion for clarity of form, which enables Homer to create a complete and independent cosmos, where changes and chances are always balanced by an element of order and stability. When we contemplate Homer and the later Greeks in one broad survey, we cannot help seeing the underlying identity of spirit. The deepest grounds of this identity lie in the unsolved secrets of heredity, blood and race. As we study them, we feel both that they are closely akin and that they are fundamentally alien to us; and it is the recognition of this necessary difference between members of the same species which is the real benefit of our intercourse withthe Hellenic world. That factor of race and nationality, which we can feel by intuition, not by logic, continues to work with a strange immutability through all the historical variations of spirit and the varying tides of fortune; but in our thought of it we must not underestimate the immeasurable effect on later Greece of Homer's creation of a complete human world. That world was the first work of the Panhellenic spirit: it made the Greeks conscious for the first time that they were a nation; and thereby it set an ineffaceable stamp on al later Greek culture.

## Homeric Nobility versus Hesiodic Peasantry

Homer's poetry brings out one fundamental fact: that all culture starts with the creation of an aristocratic ideal, shaped by deliberate cultivation of the qualities appropriate to a nobleman and a hero. We must not be deceived by the carefree life of the Homeric gentlemen into forgetting that the land of Greece always demanded hard and constant labour from its people. Slavery is a necessity. Hesiod is this slavery - such a grim life could not create any such pure ideal of human culture as was produced by the happier world in which the Homeric nobles ruled. A myth is the expression of a fundamental attitude to life. For that reason, every social class has myths of its own. In thinking of education and the conduct of life, the Hesiodic peasantry envisages nothing like the chivalrous ideal of a complete human personality, harmonious in mind and body, foursquare in battle and speech, song and action. Instead, it prizes the old moral code whose strength is in the slow, changeless wisdom of the farmer and his relentless daily toil. That code is more real and closer to the earth, although it lacks a high ideal.

(Note-to-self: Kissinger, Miya's Manor, Dorian Gods versus Pythagorean slave religion)

The hawk carried off 'the singer', the nightingale, and as he carried her of through the air in his claws, he answered her pitiful lamentations with 'Wretched creature, why are you crying? You are in the grip of one stronger than you, and you will follow me wherever I take you. And I will eat you, if I wish, or let you go.' Hesiod's poetry shows us a social class, hitherto debarred from culture and education, trying miserably to forge its own. Homeric epic is not simply the poetry of one class, but has grown from the root of an aristocratic ideal to overshadow all humanity, that it can help the men of an entirely different class to create their own culture, discover their own purpose in life, and work out its inherent law. They could imagine no higher spiritual influence than that possessed by the poet, the Homeric rhapsode. A poet could not teach unless he used the noble language of Homer, whose educational effect every Greek felt and acknowledged.

## State Education in Sparta

Greek culture first assumes its classical form in the polis or city-state. The old aristocratic society and life of the rural peasantry were not entirely superseded by this new social pattern: many survivals of the feudal and agrarian order appear in the early polis, and some persist even in later stages of its development. But the spiritual leadership of Greece was now taken over by the culture of the cities. The centre of gravity of Greek life lies in the polis. It is the polis which includes and defines every form of social and intellectual activity. The polis is the social framework of the whole history of Greek culture; and within that framework we shall set out the various achievements of 'literature' down to the end of the great age of Athens. These are the constitutional state (which was in origin Ionian) and the Spartan military state. These states represent spiritual ideals which are diametrical opposites. The opposition is a fundamental fact in the history of Greek spirit. Unless we realize that the Greek political ideal was not uniform, we cannot fully comprehend the essence of Greek culture, with its violent internal conflicts which are at last reconciled in a triumphant harmony. However, the political and spiritual differences between the Dorian and the Ionian types are quite clearly marked in the polis. The two types finally unite in the Athens of the fifth and fourth centuries. For in that period the political life of Athens was moulded on the Ionian pattern, while the Spartan ideal was reborn in the realm of the intellect, through the aristocratic influence of Attic philosophy, and eventually, in Plato's cultural ideal, coalesced in a higher unity with the fundamental tenets of the Ionian and Attic constitutional state, stripped of its democratic form.

Both in the history of philosophy and in that of art, Sparta holds a subordinate position. The Ionian race, for example, led Greece in the search for philosophical and ethical truth; but no Spartan name occurs in the long roll of Greek moralists and philosophers.However, Sparta has an unchallengeable place in the history of education. Her most characteristic achievement was her state; and the Spartan state is the first which can be called, in the largest sense, an educational force. The chief source of information is Xenophon's State of the Lacedaemonians — a product of the political and philosophical romanticism of the fourth century, which held the Spartan state to be a sort of political revelation from heaven. 

The only guarantee of its great antiquity is Sparta's reputation for rigid conservatism - the creed which made her the ideal of all aristocrats and the abomination of all democrats. Spartan militarism was the survival of a very ancient era in Dorian history. The Greeks never lostthe tradition of the Dorian migration. It was the last of those population-movements from the north of the Balkan peninsula, by which peoples probably originating in central Europe entered Greece and mingled with a different race, the old-established Mediterranean stock, to produce the Greeks of history. The national type of the invaders remained purest in Sparta. The Dorian race gave Pindar his ideal of the fair-haired warrior of proud descent, which he used to describe not only the Homeric Menelaus, but the greatest Greek hero Achilles, and ni fact al 'the fair-haired Danaans' of the heroic age.

The primary fact about Sparta is that the Spartiates themselves were only a small master-class of later origin than the majority of its population. Below them were the free-born labouring peasantry, the perioikoi, and the conquered and enslaved helots, who were serfs with practically no legal rights. The old accounts of the Spartans describe them as living in a perpetual armed camp. What the Greeks called the legislation of Lycurgus was the opposite of legislation in their usual sense. It was not a codification of separate civil and constitutional laws, but a nomos in the original sense of the word—it was current oral tradition. Only a few fundamental laws were solemnly passed and fixed in writing -the rhetrai, among which was the law definingthe character of the popular assembly, recorded by Plutarch. The conception of Lycurgus as the schoolmaster of Sparta is based on an idealization of Spartan life by later philosophers, who interpreted it by contemporary cultural theories. They were misled, by comparing Sparta with the sad degeneration of later Attic democracy, into believing that the Spartan system was deliberately created by a legislative genius. The archaic communal life of the Spartan men, living like soldiers in barracks and eating at common mess-tables, the predominance of their public life over their private life, the public education of the youth of both sexes, and the sharp cleavage between the industrial and agrarian canaille and the free Spartiate master- class, who did not work but devoted themselves to the hunt, the practice of war, and their official duties-the whole system seemed to be the deliberate realization of the philosopher's educational ideal, such an ideal as Plato proposed in the Republic. In fact, Plato's ideal, like other theories of paideia, was largely based on the Spartan model, although the spirit of it was quite new. The great social problem of al later Greek educators was to determine how individualism might be repressed and the character of every citizen might be developed on one communal model. The Spartan state, with its rigid authoritarianism, appeared to be the solution of this problem in actual practice; and as such it occupied Plato's mind throughout his life. Plutarch too, who was a staunch follower of Plato's educational ideals, constantly recurred to this belief. 'Education,' he writes in his life of Lycurgus, 'extended. to grown men and women. Nobody was free to live as he wished, but as if in a camp everyone had his way of life and his public duties fixed, and he held that he did not belong to himself but to his country.' And in another passage he says, 'In general Lycurgus made the citizens accustomed to have neither the will nor the ability to lead a private life; but, like the bees, always to be organic parts of their community, to cling together around the leader, and, in an ecstasy of enthusiasm and selfess ambition, to belong wholly to their country.' It was to them that Zeus gave the land, according to the old legend which described the Dorian immigration into the Peloponnese as 'the return of the race of Heracles'. 

It was actually very difficult for acitizen of post-Periclean Athens, with its creed of complete individualism, to understand Sparta. Plato and Xenophon believed that the constitution of Sparta was the work of a single educational genius, with the authority of a dictator and the foresight of a philosopher. Actually, it was the survival of an earlier, simpler stage in social life, the stage which is characterized by strong racial and communal solidarity and scant individual initiative. That tradition was created by an age which thought the Spartan system was deliberately created to serve an educational purpose, and which believed a priori that the highest end and meaning of the state was paideia - namely, a process by which the life of each citizen should be shaped to conform with some absolute norm. All Spartan citizens were subjected to the system ofmilitary training, and therefore were a sort of aristocracy. 

The will which made Sparta a great nation still lives in the elegies of Tyrtaeus. It had the power to create agreat ideal—a power which long survived historical Sparta, and is not yet exhausted; and these poems are the strongest manifestation of that power. The elegies of Tyrtaeus are inspired by a mighty educational ideal. The standards they impose on every citizen's thoughts and actions were' not produced by a momentary outburst of warlike patriotism; they were the foundation of the whole Spartan cosmos. Tyrtaeus is not an individual poetic genius, in the modern sense of the word. He is the voice of the people. He utters the faith of every right-thinking citizen. For that reason he often speaks in the first person plural: 'let us fight!' he cries, and let us die!' Even when he says 'I', he is not giving free expression to his own personality, nor is he speaking as a superior authority (as the ancients thought; they even called him a general); he is the universal I, he is what Demosthenes calls 'the general voice of the country'. The dreadful crisis of the long and doubtful war which was then beginning was to forge the iron framework of Sparta's state. For that dark hour, she needed not only resolute leadership, both political and military, but a universally valid expression of the new virtues which were being fired in the white heat of war.

Apart from the elegiac metre itself—which in the earliest times had no special name to distinguish it from the heroic metre—there is only one constant element in elegiac poetry. It is always addressed to someone: either to one individual or to a collection of people. The elegy expresses a latent bond between the speaker and his audience, and that bond is the distinguishing mark of all elegiac poetry. This admonitory address is a clear expression of the educational character of the elegy. It shares that character with the epic, but (like Hesiod's didactic poetry) makes its address more direct than epic, more deliberate, more definite in its object. The epic with its mythical examples is set in an imaginary world; the elegy, with its address to real concrete people, takes us into the actual situation which inspired the poet. Tyrtaeus had only to transfer the vast moral impetus of these speeches from Homer's imaginary battles to the real struggles of the Messenian war, and he had created his elegy. We shall understand that spiritual transference better if we read Homer as the age of Tyrtaus and Hesiod read him - not as the narrator of the past, but as the teacher of the present. He has recast the Homeric ideal of the single champion's areté into the areté of the patriot, and with that new faith he strives to inspire his whole society. He is endeavouring to create anation of heroes. Death is beautiful, if it is a hero's death; and to die for one's country is a hero's death. Tyrtaeus' virtues 'I would not honour him for these things, even if he had every glory except warlike valour. For no one is a good man in war, unless he can bear to see bloody slaughter and can press hard on the enemy, standing face to face. That is areté! That is the best and fairest prize which a young man can win among men. That is a good which is common to all—to the city and the whole people—when a man takes his stand and holds his ground relentlessly among the foremost fighters and casts away all thought of shameful flight.' We must not call this 'late rhetoric'. Solon speaks in the same way. The origins of rhetorical style go bacl far into history. Tyrtaeus' excited repetitions are prompted by the deep emotion with which he asks his central question - what is true arete?'

The close community of the city-state, which seemed at the beginning of the poem to be only an obligation, now appears as a privilege and an honour: it is the source of all ideal values. The first part states the heroic ideal of areté in terms of the city- state. The second restates, ni the same terms, the heroic ideal of glory. Areté and glory are inseparable in the epic. Glory is now to be given, and areté to be exercised, by and in the city-state. The polis lives when the individual dies; and so it is a safe guardian of the 'name' and, with it, of the future life of a hero. The early Greek city-state was small, but it had something truly heroic and truly human in its nature. Greece, and ni fact al the ancient world, held the hero to be the highest type of humanity. The polis was a universal, with a religious basis. As opposed to the areté of the heroic age, the new areté of the polis is an expression of a change in Greek religious ideals. The polis has become the epitome of all things human and divine. In his attempt to substitute a city-state morality for an aristocratic morality, and in his advocacy of the acceptance of every citizen within the state as one of its warriors, Tyrtaeus is much more of a revolutionary. To explain the position given to soldiers in his ideal state, Plato copies Tyrtaeus' injunction to honour the fighter more highly than the Olympic victor. In the Laws, he tells us that fourth century Sparta still counted Tyrtaeus' poems the highest revelation of the spirit of the Dorian state, of that spirit which trained all its citizens to display the same courage in war. In Sparta, as Alman's poetry shows, women were much more free in both public and private life than the women of Ionia, which was influenced by Asiatic ideals and of Athens, which copied Ionia. Like many other Dorian characteristics in speech and habits this is a pure survival from the time of the conquering invaders of Greece: the vigour and freedom of that early age were felt in Sparta far longer than in any other of the Hellenic states.

## The City State and its Ideal of Justice 

Sparta's share in forming the ideal of man as a citizen is easier to define than the rest of Greece, because it is impossible to name any other city in which decisive steps towards this ideal were taken. We have no reliable evidence to guide us until we reach Athens at the beginning of the sixth century: it was there and then that the new spirit which inspired the state found expression in the poetry of Solon. Yet Athens was the last of the great Greek cities to appear in history, and her constitutional ideals presuppose a long anterior development.

Odysseus himself is not so much a knightly warrior as the embodiment of the adventurous spirit, the explorer's energy, and the clever practical wisdom of the Ionian: he has seen men and cities, and he is never at a loss in any difficulty or danger. Versatility, individual initiative, and wide vision are the chief characteristics of the new men created by these new conditions. As the physical horizon expanded, their spiritual horizon had grown too, and their sense of their own powers made them capable of wider and higher thoughts and ideals. The spirit of independent criticism which we see in Ionia both in the personal poetry of Archilochus and in the theories of the Milesian philosophers must have affected public life also. We have no records of the civil conflicts which must have taken place in Ionia as they did elsewhere in the Greek world. But the long succession of Ionian epigrams and poems which extol Justice as the basis of human society tuns from the later portions of the Homeric epics through Archilochus and Anaximander down to Heraclitus. As we might imagine, such praise of justice by poets and philosophers did not precede the struggle to realize the ideal, but was plainly a natural repercussion of the political struggles which lasted from the eighth century to the beginning of the fifth. The poets of Greece proper, from Hesiod downwards, spoke of Justice in the same tone, and none more clearly than Solon of Athens. Until these struggles began, the right of nobles to administer justice - in accordance with tradition usage, not by any written code of law - had been unchallenged. Political philosophers of later centuries depended on the notion of diké and seek only to redefine the concept of equality which had become so mechanized by the rise of democracy as to become repugnant to Plato and Aristotle, with their aristocratic belief in the natural inequality of mankind. The old free ideal of the heroic areté of the Homeric champion now became a duty to the state, a duty to which all citizens alike are bound, as they are bound to observe the limits of meum and tuum in matters of property. Later ages did not recognize the fact that the ethical systems of Plato and Aristotle were based on themorality of the early city-state; for they were accustomed to thinking of those systems as timeless and eternal. 

Philosophy cannot live by pure reason: it is only the translation into abstract and ideal form of a culture which has grown up by historical stages. Certainly that is true of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle; it cannot be understood without Greek civilization, and Greek civilization cannot be understood apart from it. For the city-state culture also assimilated the morality of an earlier age. It took over not only Homer's heroic areté but the athletic virtues too—the whole ideal of aristocracy; the same assimilation took place in Sparta too at the age when she first appeared in history. Nowadays, we naturally think first of the state's claim to educate all its citizens during their youth. But public education was not advocated in Greece until it became a thesis of fourth century philosophy: Sparta alone, at this carly period, paid direct attention to the education of the young. Nevertheless, even outside Sparta, the early city-state educated the members of its community, by utilizing the athletic and musical competitions which were held during the festivals of the gods. These competitions were the noblest reflection of the physical and spiritual culture of the age. Plato rightly calls gymnastics and music 'the old established culture. That culture, which had originally been aristocratic, was fostered by the state through great and costly competitions; and these competitions did more than encourage musical taste and gymnastic skill. 

The polis is the sum of all its citizens and of all the aspects of their lives. It gives each citizen much, but it can demand all in return. Relentless and powerful, it imposesits way of life on each individual, and marks him for its own. From it are derived all the norms which govern the life of its citizens. Conduct that injures it is bad, conduct that helps it is good. This is the paradoxical result of the passionate effort to obtain the rights and equal status of each individual. All these efforts have forged the new chains of Law, to hold together the centrifugal energies of mankind, and to co-ordinate them far more successfully than ni the old social order. Law is the objective expression of the state, and now Law has become king, as the Greeks later said - an invisible ruler who does not only prevent the strong from transgressing and bring the wrongdoer to justice, but issues positive commands in all the spheres of life which had once been governed by individual will and preference. Even the most intimate acts of the private life and the moral conduct of its citizens are by law prescribed and limited and defined. Thus, through the struggle to obtain law, the development of the state brings into being new and more sharply differentiated principles of public and private life.

And that is the significance of the new city-state in the shaping of Greek character. Plato says, that every type of constitution produces its own type of man; both he and Aristotle claim that all education should, in the perfect state, bear the imprint of the spirit of the state. Again and again the great Athenian political philosophers of the fourth century formulate this ideal in the words 'education in the spirit of the laws'. The words show that to establish a legal standard by written law was for the Greeks an educational act. Law is the most important stage in the development of Greek culture from the social ideal of aristocracy to the fundamental conception of man as an individual, as expressed by the philosophers. And the ethical and educational systems constructed by philosophers constantly recall, in both form and content, the legislation of earlier periods. Such systems do not come into being in the empty air of pure thought: they are rooted in the historical life of the nation - as the ancient philosophers themselves said - and do but translate it into the region of abstract and general ideas. Law was the most universal and permanent form of Greek moral and legal experience. The culmination of Plato's work as a philosophical educator comes in his last and greatest book, when he himself turns lawgiver; and Aristotle closes the Ethics by calling for a legislator to realize the ideal he has formulated.

(Note-to-self: Link Heraclitus and Anaximander here)

All thinkers of the early period unite in praising law: Heraclitus 'the people must fight for their law as for their walls.' Anaximander transfers the concept of diké from the social life of the city state to the realm of nature, he explains the causal connection between coming-to-be and passing-away as equivalent to a lawsuit, in which all things are compelled by the decision of time to compensate each other for their unrighteousness. This is the origin of the philsophical idea of the cosmos: for the word originally signifies the right order in a state or other community. We can see the close connection between the origins of Ionian philosophy and the birth of the constitutional city-state. Both are rooted in the universal idea which, starting from this point, inspires Greek civilization more and more deeply—the idea that the world and life in all their appearances can be interpreted by one fundamental standard. After all the Ionian city-states came into being through the development of the old aristocratic civilization into the idea of universal culture. 

It is obvious why the new ideal of the individual as citizen cannot be based (like Hesiod's ideal of popular education) on the conception of man's daily work. The new factor in the development of the city-state, which at last made every man a political being, was the compulsion laid on each male citizen to take an active part in the public life of his community, and to recognize and accept his civic duties-which were quite different from his duties as a private person and a working man. But, it was only the nobleman who had possessed this 'universal' political ability. For centuries power had been in the hands of the aristocrats, and they had a vastly superior system of political education and experience, which was still indispensable. The new city-state could not, without injuring itself, ignore the areté of the aristocracy; but it was bound to repress its selfish and unjust misuse. That was at least the ideal of the polis, as expressed by Pericles in Thucydides. Thus, in free Ionia as in authoritarian Sparta, the culture of the city-state was based on the old aristocratic culture—on the ideal of areté, which embraced the whole personality and all its powers. The working-class morality of Hesiod was not abandoned; but the citizen of the polis aimed above all at the ideal which Phoenix had taught Achilles: to be a speaker of words and a doer of deeds.

In the Laws Plato constructs just such an old Hellenic cosmos based on law, a city in which the polis is the spirit, and in which all spiritual activity is referred to the polis as its final end. There he defines the essence of all true culture, or paideia (in contrast to the specialized knowledge of tradesmen such as the shopkeeper and the travelling merchant), as 'the education in areté from youth onwards, which makes men passionately desire to become perfect citizens, knowing both how to rule and how to be ruled on a basis of justice'. Plato's words are a true description of the original meaning of 'universal' culture as conceived in the early city-state. The contrast between the factual knowledge of the craftsman and the ideal culture of the citizen, with its reference to his entire personality and life, goes back ot the aristocratic ideal of early Greece. But its deeper meaning first appears in the city-state, because there that ideal was imposed upon the whole community, and aristocratic culture became the force which formed every man as a citizen. Aristocracy is the first, and the early city-state is the second, of the vital stages in the development of the 'humanistic' ideal of a universal ethico-political culture: in fact, the historical mission of the city-state was to lead Greece towards that ideal. The ideal of universal political areté is indispensable because it implies the constant creation and regeneration of a governing class; and without such a governing class no nation and no state, whatever be its constitution, can long survive.

## Ionian and Aeolian Poetry: The Individual Shapes His Own Personality

The revolution which rebuilt the state on the common basis of law created a new type of human - the citizen - and compelled the new community to work out a universal standard for civic life. The city-state, as we have seen, eagerly assimilated the earlier stages of Greek culture, and in so doing utilized the great poetry of antiquity as a means of expressing its own ideals, just as it used the musical and athletic traditions of the era of aristocracy. The city-state was a new development in communal living, created by the struggle to subject al members of the community to a rigid legal code of life and conduct: it therefore persistently strove to express that code in clear and universally valid sentences. The violence of this effort occupied men's minds to the exclusion of any wish to express in poetry the character of the new community. But poetry did find a new world, and explored it eagerly: the world of purely individual experience, far narrower than the city walls, bounded ni fact by the close circle of personal intimacies. This is the world opened to us by the Aeolian lyrics and the elegiac and iambic poetry of Ionia. 

But the personal nature of these very lyrics shows their essential difference from the early Greek conception of individuality. Although the Greek poet, in exploring the new world of individuality, expresses ideas and emotions which are truly personal, he is still somehow bound by universal standards, and recognizes the law which rules his fellow-men. It is naturally difficult to give a sharp definition of the meaning of individuality in Archilochus and poets of his type, when the idea has long been familiar to us. Certainly it was not the Christian ideal of personality, by which every soul feels its own individual value. The Greeks always thought of personality as actively related to the world (in fact, to two worlds, the world of nature and the world of human society) and not as isolated from it. Therefore Greek expressions of personal emotion and thought have nothing purely and exclusively subjective in them: it might rather be said that a poet like Archilochus has learnt how to express in his own personality the whole objective world and its laws - to represent them in himself. Personality, for the Greeks, gains its liberty and its consciousness of selfhood not by abandoning itself to subjective thought and feeling,but by making itself an objective thing; and, as it realizes that it is a separate world opposed to the external law, it discovers its own inner laws.

One important fact in the history of culture is that Sparta's civic ideal is expressed in poetry by a direct translation and adaptation to the real present of the Homeric parainesis, the speech which encourages men ot heroic courage. The same process of adaptation is now repeated in Archilochus; except that the Spartan army, the whole community, is now replaced by the personality of the poet himself. Again and again in his elegies Archilochus or his surroundings take on Homeric characters and destinies. In such adaptations of form and content we can clearly see the completion of Homer's great educational mission: for now the epic is taking possession of individual personality and character, and the formative influence of Homer has contributed above all else to raise the individual to a higher stage of freedom in life and thought. The chains of chivalrous honour and class prejudice are loosening, and have already been shaken of by the soldiers of fortune. But it is still a long way to the philosophical revolution in moral standards which set up 'nature' as the sole norm for personal conduct. 

In the earliest type of Greek society there was no more powerful judge of human conduct than Fama, public opinion. From its judgments there was no appeal. The Homeric nobleman agrees with the Hesiodic peasant and craftsman in bowing before it. But Archilochus speaks for a freer world when he proclaims his independence of the demos's judgment of right and wrong, fame and shame: 'If one cared for the gossip of the people one would never have much pleasure in life.' A man who sees so clearly through the psychology of public opinion, and has realized the baseness of the mass of mankind, has lost all trace of respect for the voice of the people. Homer said that the mind of men is as changeable as the day which Zeus bring forth. It is because Archilochus knows that he is juding the men he blames by a universal, not a personal standard, that he can so easily abandon his own personality. 

The old aristocratic morality worshipped public opinion as a higher power, interpreting it differently - for the nobleman thought that public opinion meant fame for great deeds and their joyful acknowledgment by his generous peers. But that standard becomes absurd when it means the gossip of the jealous commoner who measures every great man by his own little yardmeasure. As such, public opinion is only a necessary safeguard against the new freedom of thought and action which has been produced by the new city-state spirit. The ideal on which this proud independence is built is not the purely practical counsel of moderation as the safest course in daily existence. It is the universal conception that there is a 'rhythm' in all human life. That is the foundation on which Archilochus bases his exhortation to self-control and his warning to avoid excessive joy or grief—he means, to avoid feeling excessive emotion for externals, for the happiness or unhappiness which comes from destiny. This sense of 'rhythm' is probably an early trace of the conception which first appears in lonian natural philosophy and historical thinking-the idea that there is an objective law of averages in the natural course of existence. Rhythm then is that which imposes bonds on movement and confines the flux of things: just as it is in Archilochus. In Archilochus we see the miracle of a new, personal form of culture, founded on the conscious realization of a natural and final basic pattern in human life. To this pattern human thoughts and desires can be made to conform, without the compulsion of traditional morality. Man's thought now becomes master of his life; and, just as it attempts to codify universal laws for the life of the city-state community, so it strives to invade the soul and to control within fixed frontiers the chaos of warring passions. During the succeeding centuries this struggle is reflected in Grek poerty for philosophy does not enter it until much later. Archilochus' work is an important stage on the road which poetry travels down from Homer to the fourth century. His poetry, and that of his age, was born of the need of the free individual to see and solve the problem of human life outside the mythical content of epic poetry, which had hitherto been the only sphere in which it could be posed or answered. As the poets assimilated the ideas and problems which had been set forth in the epic, and literally made them their own, they naturally created for them new poetic forms, the elegy and the iambus, and gave them a direct bearing on their own personal lives. It is the conclusion of an eclectic generation, for which the lofty code of the heroic age has lost much of its deep seiousness and which chooses from that code the part which suits its own outlook. 

The libertarian ideal is that expressed by Pericles in the funeral speech, when he describes the free Athenian ideal as the counterpart to Spartan severity: 'We do not grudge our neighbour his private pleasures, nor do we make him repent them by our bitter looks.' It was necessary for the rigid legal code of the city state to allow the instincts of its citizens to have some play; and if the cry for liberty changed to a cry for pleasure, that is a very human impulse. It is not true individualism, for it does not come into conflict with supra-individual forces. Yet, within the boundaries which they set, there is a palpable broadening of the individual's demand for happiness; in the balance of life and duty, the individual now casts his weight more strongly on the side of life. The Athenian civilization of the Periclean age recognized the principle of the distinction between a state's demands and the individual's wishes; but a fight was needed to gain that recognition, and the fight was won in Ionia. There arose the first poetry of hedonism, passionately vindicating the individual's right to sensual happiness and beauty, and asserting the worthlessness of a life lacking these things - a growing tendency to see everything as it affects the individuals right to live. The hedonist school of poetry marks one of the most important phases in the history of the Greek spirit. To prove its importance we need only remember that Greek logic always posed the problem of the individual will in ethics and politics as a conflict between pleasure and nobility.

The direction of this spiritual development is unmistakably centrifugal. It is as great a force in loosening the social structure of the city-state as the power of law had been in binding it together. These new impulses could not have gained utterance and recognition except in the didactic and reflective form wrought out by the post-Archilochean iambic and elegiac poets. When they preach hedonism, it is not the chance preference of an individual; it is a universal principle, the right' of every individual to enjoy his own life. Every poem of Semonides and Mimnermus reminds us that it was written in the age when the Greeks began to apply logic to nature, at the birth of Milesian nature-philosophy. Archilochus' work is a necessary prelude to Sappho and Alcaeus; yet even his hate-poems, which are so filled with his own passions and prejudices, are oriented by a universal moral standard. Sappho actually translated her most intimate and subjective life into immortal humanity without robbing it of the charm of immediate experience. The marvellous process by which the inner soul of man shapes itself in Aeolian lyric poetry is no less miraculous than the contemporary creation of philosophy and the constitutional state by the Greeks of Asia Minor. Miracle though it is, it must not blind us to the fact that the Acolian lyric, like other forms of Greek poetry, is rooted in the life of the community. The symposium, or drinking-party, was for Greek men — through its free friendly companionship and its fine intellectual tradition — the capital of the newly conquered realm of individual liberty. Therefore we find that men express their personalities chiefly through poems written for the drinking-party. To the masculine heroism of tradition, Sappho's songs, quivering with the rapture of complete and harmonious friendship, added the ardour and nobility ofthe feminine soul. They depict an ideal third life between childhood and marriage — an age in which women were educated to attain the highest possible nobility of spirit. The feminine Eros, still charming us by his melodious and tender songs, was yet strong enough to create a true community among the souls of his worshippers. Thus he was more than mere emotion: he must have joined the souls which he inspired in some higher unity. From her poems it is clear that Eros was a passion which shook its victim's whole being, and held the senses no less firmly than the soul. Sappho's highest art is her gift in describing her inner experience with the unemotional simplicity of a folk-song, and yet with the sensuous directness of personal feeling. But it is not mere chance that such a depth of individuality was possible only for a woman, and that a woman was capable of it only through the power given her by love.

## Solon: Creator of Athenian Political Culture 

THe voice of Athens was heard for the first time in the choir of Hellas about the year 600. At first she seemed only to imitate and elaborate the melodies of others (and above all of her Ionian kinsmen), but soon she wove them into a nobler harmony as a background for her own clearer and more commanding tones. Her genius did not reach its full power until it created the tragedies of Aeschylys a century later; and we are fortunate to know even a little of its achievements before that. Nothing survives from the sixth century except considerable fragments of Solon's poetry, who was revered as a keystone is keystone of its culture. Boys at the beginning of their schooling learned his poems by heart; and they were constantly cited as the classical expression of the soul of Athenian citizenship by advocates in the lawcourts and orators in the public assembly. So fully did her citizens realize that the intellectual and artistic life of each individual had both its origin and its purpose in the community, that the Athenian state dominated the lives of its members to a degree unparalleled outside Sparta.

Sparta, for all the nobility and firm resolution of her communal life, left no room for the individual will to develop, and gradually became a fossilized relic of the past with her inability to change. Ionia on the other hand, found in the ideal of justice the organizing principle of a new social order; and at the same time, by abolishing class privilege and establishing the liberty of all its members, gave each individual citizen room for the free development of his own potentialities. Yet, while it made these concessions to ordinary human nature, it was unable to develop powers which might unite the surging new individual energies in a higher effort to serve and strengthen the community. These two moments - the educational force which is evidenced by the new supremacy of law within the state, and the untrammelled liberty of speech and thought enjoyed by the Ionian poets - were not yet linked by a single purpose. The culture of Athens was the first to strike a balance between the outward-striving energy of the individual and the unifying power of the state. Despite the great debt of political and intellectual education which Athens owed to Ionia, it is always easy to trace the fundamental difference between the libertarianism of Ionia, which is centrifugal, and the constructive genius of Athens, which is centripetal. That distinction explains why the first great expressions of the Greek spirit in the sphere of education and culture were Athenian. The mightiest achievements of Greek political thought, from Solon to Plato, Thucydides, and Demosthenes, are without exception the work of Athenian citizens. They were possible only in a state which could subordinate all spiritual activities to the life of the community and yet make them part of that life.

We have already observed that legislation was one of the greatest forces in forming the new civic sense. Solon's poems are the clearest illustration of that truth. Their special value for us is that they show us, behind the impersonal abstractions of the law, the spiritual personality of the lawgiver, a visible embodiment of that educational force of law of which the Greeks were so vividly aware. The culture of the Athenian nobility was Ionian through and through. Both its art and its poetry were moulded by the superior taste and convention of the kindred race. It was natural that Ionian influences should also affect its manner of life and its ideals: Solon was making a concession to the feelings of the common people when he legislated to forbid the Asiatic pomp and the women's lamentations which had until then been part of the funeral ceremony of every nobleman. Solon is convinced that justice is an inseparable part of the divine world-order. He is never tired of proclaiming that it is impossible to ignore the power of Dike, because it is always victorious in the end. Sooner or later punishment comes, and man's hybris must pay the penalty for overstepping the bounds set by justice. Yet when we examine Solon's idea of punishment we can see how his ideals differ from the religious realism of Hesiod's faith ni justice. He does not imagine divine punishment to mean pestilence and famine, as Hesiod does He thinks of it as immanent in the state, for every transgression of justice is a disturbance of the social organism. The social evil is like an epidemic, which strikes everyone in the doomed city; and, says Solon, it comes inevitably to every city which stirs up civil strife and class-war. This is not a prophetic vision, it is a statesman's diagnosis of the facts. It is the first objective statement of the universal truth that the violation of justice means the disruption of the life of the community; and Solon is eager to drive home his discovery.

It should be remembered that at the same time in Ionia the Milesian natural philosophers, Thales and Anaximander, were moving boldly towards the conception of a permanent law in the eternal coming-to-be and passing-away of nature. Solon, like them, was impelled to demonstrate the existence of an immanent order in the course of nature and human life, and with it an inherent meaning and an essential norm in reality. With Ionian scientific ideas as a pattern, it was easier for Solon than for anyone before him to establish the fact that the political life of a community is subject to definite laws. He is clearly presupposing a law connecting cause and effect in nature, and expressly setting forth as a parallel to it the rule of law in the social order, when he says elsewhere, 'From the clouds come snow and hail, thunder follows the lightning, and by powerful men the city is brought low and the demos in its ignorance comes into the power of a despot.' Tyranny—the domination of one noble family and its head, supported by the common people, over all the rest of the aristocracy-was the most dreadful danger which Solon could predict for the Attic Eupatrids, for it meant the immediate end of their centuries-old mastery of the state.

At the beginning of the Odyssey, Zeus the father of gods and men, speaks to the assembled gods of the unjust complaints of mankind, who blame heaven for every misfortune in human life. And he asserts, in almost the same words used by Solon, that men themselves, and not the gods, increase their troubles by their own folly. Solon's poems are conscious reminiscences of the Homeric theodicy. The earliest religion of Greece taught that all human misery, whether it came from external causes or from the will and impulse of the sufferer himself, was caused by an inevitable até, the agent of a higher power. The philosophical idea which the author of the Odyssey puts in the mouth of Zeus, as governor of heaven and earth, represents a later stage of ethical thought; for it distinguishes divine até, the unforeseen and inevitable doom sent by heaven, from human responsibility, which brings men greater misery than the portion allotted to them by heaven. The essential feature of the latter is foreknowledge-evil action deliberately willed. That is the point where Solon's belief in the importance of justice for a healthy social life joins the Homeric theodicy and gives it a new depth of thought. Recognition of the universal truth that every community is bound by immanent laws implies that every man is a responsible moral agent with a duty to be done. Thus in Solon's world there is far less scope for the arbitrary interference of the gods than in the world of the Iliad; for it is governed by law, and attributes to the will of men many events which in the Homeric world were the gifts or inflictions of heaven. Accordingly, the gods merely carry into execution the effects of the moral order, which is identical with their will.

Solon's elegy to the Muses is inspired by the old aristocratic moral code-known to us chiely from Theognis and Pindar, as well as from the Odyssey—with its traditional emphasis on material wealth and social prestige. But it revises that code to harmonize with Solon's deep faith in law and divine justice. Here, as throughout his poetry, the thought recurs that injustice can maintain itself only for a brief time, and diké always comes sooner or later.

## Philosophical Speculation: The Discovery of the World Order 

In the age of the Presocratics and society, the poet was still the undisputed leader of his people; and he was being joined by the law-giver and statesman.

It is hard to fix the point when rational thinking begins in Greece. The line should run through the Homeric epic. Yet it is hardly possible to separate 'mythical thinking' in the epic from the rational ideas with which it is interpenetrated. If we analysed the epics from this point of view we should find that logic invaded mythology quite early, and began to transform it. There is no discontinuity between Ionian natural philosophy and the Homeric epics. The history of Greek thought is an organic unity, closed and complete. To adapt a phrase of Kant, mythical thought without the formative logos is blind, and logical theorizing without living mythical thought is empty. From that point of view we must interpret the growth of Greek philosophy as the process by which the original religious conception of the universe, the conception implicit in the myth, was increasingly rationalized.

We must include in our survey not only natural philosophy, but also the constructive ethical, political and religious thought from Solon and the Ionian poets from Archilochus onwards, then we will have a complete view of the origins of philosophical speculation about man aswell as nature. The only difference is that political theory is naturally practical, while speculation about physis or genesis is theoretical. The Greeks did not think of human nature as a theoretical problem until, by studying the external world, especially through medicine and mathematics, they had established an exact technique on which to begin a study of the inner nature of man. 

The Greek spirit, trained to think of the external cosmos as goverened by fixed laws, searches for inner laws that govern the soul, and at last discovers an objective view of the internal cosmos. Thus, in the fact that the philosophy of the soul was preceded by the philosophy of nature, there is a deep historical meaning which comes out when we study the history of culture as a whole. The lofty speculations of the early Ionians were not intended to educate Greece; yet they were, in the midst of the chaotic growth of a new society, and the collapse of the old mythical conception of the universe, a fresh attempt to solve the deepest problem of life, the problem of Being itself.

The most notable feature in the character of the first philosophers - of course they did not call themselves by that Platonic name - is their intellectual devotion to knowledge, their absorption in studying Existence for its own sake. In the stories handed down in the Platonic school, the philosopher is modelled as the great eccentric, an uncanny but lovable character, who deliberately isolates himself from the society of men in order to live for his studies. He is childishly naive, awkward and impractical; he lives in eternity, not in time and space. The boldness with which these philosophers applied pure independent logic to the current conception of the universe is parallel to the courage of the Ionian poets in voicing their emotions and opinions on human life and their own age. Both ventures are based on the growing power of the individual. At this stage logic works like an explosive. The oldest authorities shake and fall under its impact. Nothing is correct but that which I can explain to myself on conclusive grounds, that for which my thought can reasonably account. The whole of Ionian literature is filled with this spirit and expounds its criticisms in the characteristic first personal form. Yet in this victory of the rational I over traditional authority, there is a latent force which is to triumoh over the individual: the concept of truth, a new universal category to which every personal preference must yield. 

It is true that a rational science of nature was created by the same movement of inquiring into the origin of the universe, but it was at first embedded in metaphysical speculation, and only gradually became an independent branch of research. In the Greek conception of physics two subjects are confused: the inquiry into the origin of the universe (which compels reason to move beyond phenomena observed by the senses), and the comprehension of everything which proceeds from that origin and now exists by empirical investigation. When they subjected the myths dealing with the real and visible world, the myths of creation, to theoretical and causal inquiry. That is the true origion of scientific thought. That is a historical achievement of the Greeks. 

Anaximander's conception of the earth and the universe is a triumph of geometrical imagination. And there is a tradition that Anaximander declared the apeiron, constantly producing new worlds * and assimilating them again, was the divine. Thus, when things are produced by the apeiron, they leave the original unity in which all the warring contraries of this world are brought together in peace. To this creed we must apply the great saying - the only one which is directly stated to be Anaximander's own: — 'It is necessary that things should pass away into that from which they are born. For things must pay one another the penalty and compensation for their injustice according to the ordinance of time.' It should be obvious that Anaximander is speaking of the pleonexia or aggrandisement of things against one another. Existence in itself is not a sin - that is a non-Greek idea. The words are a personification of the strife between things, which is compared to a lawsuit among men. Dike does not depend on human, her power is immanent, manifested in the process by which all inequalities compensate themselves in time; and that inevitable process is the 'punishment of Zeus', or 'divine requital'. Anaximander goes much further. He holds that this eternal process of compensation is at work not only in human life but in the whole world. To a modern eye this appears to be the dawn of the majestic idea that all nature is subject to universal laws. But Anaximander was not thinking of the monotonous causal series which modern saintists core. There is a deeply religious meaning in his conception that natural phenomena are governed by a moral standards. It is not acompendious description of events, but a justification of the nature of the universe: he shows creation to be a cosmos 'writ large'-namely a community of things under law." Therefore we are justified in describing his conception of the universe as the spiritual discovery of the cosmos. The discovery could not be made anywhere but in the depths of the human soul. It has nothing to do with telescopes, observatories, or any kind of empirical research. It was produced by intuitive thought, the same kind of thought which created the idea (also ascribed to Anaximander) of the infinite number of universes. 

Solon's ethico-legal conception of responsibility and retribution was derived from the epic theodicy; similarly Anaximander's doctrine of the systematic justice of the universe reminds us that the most important idea in the new philosophy, that of Cause, was originally the same as the idea of Retribution, and was transferred from legal to physical terminology. His idea of dike is the first stage in the projection of life of the city-state upon the life of the universe.

While Anaximander had believed the universe to be a cosmos of things governed by the absolute power of justice, the Pythagoreans conceived that the principle of the cosmos was harmony. He had established the causal necessity (calling it the justice' of existence) of the sequence of temporal phenomena; and they in turn emphasized the harmony, the structural aspect of the cosmos under its laws. The influence of harmony affected not only sculpture and architecture, but poetry and rhetoric, religion and morality; all Greece came to realize that whatever a man made or did was governed by a severe rule, which like the rule of justice could not be transgressed with impunity — the rule of fitness or propriety. Unless we trace the boundless working of this law in all spheres of Greek thought throughout classical and post-classical times, we cannot realize the powerful educative influence of the discovery of harmony. The conceptions of rhythm of relation, and of the mean are closely akin to it, or derive from it a more definite content. It is true not only of the idea of the cosmos, but also of harmony and rhythm, that it was necessary for Greece to discover their existence in the nature of being before she could empliy them in the spiritual world, to find order and method in human life. And the Orphic notion that the soulwas a guest from heaven, sojourning for a time in the mortal life of earth, leads straight to the abrupt cleavage between soul and body, and so to the idea that the body is essentially bad. To look for solace against the truth of death men turned to belief in a divine destiny of the soul. The Orphic conception of the soul marks an important advance in the development of man's consciousness of selfhood. Without it Plato and Aristotle could never have developed the theory that the human spirit is divine," and that man's sensual nature can be dissociated from his real self, which it is his true function to bring to perfection. 'And such I am one' Empedocles says, 'a wanderer banished by God'. In the cosmos revealed by the physicists, the soul can find no home; but it redeems itself by its religious consciousness of selfhood.  

Xenophanes was a poet: his work was an invasion of poetry by the spirit of philosophy. That is a sure sign that philsophy was becoming a cultural force, for poetry was then, as always, the true expression of a national culture. In the impluse which moved philosophy to put on poetic form we can see the whole of its power over man — its claim to complete supremacy over the whole soul, with its domination of reason and emotion alike. The new lonian medium of prose was coming into favour very slowly, and had much less influence than poetry: for while prose, written in one local dialect, commanded a narrow audience, poetry used the language of Homer and was truly Panhellenic in speech. And the influence which Xenophanes meant his poems to have was Panhellenic. Even Empedocles, who was a physicist, and Parmenides, who was an abstract logician and metaphysician, used the Hesiodic type of didactic poem as their medium.

The first attack of the city-state morality on the old chivalrous deal was by Tyrtaeus, 'This is a good shared by all the city.' Xenophanes modelled his poem on the elegy of Tyrtaeus, his ideal marks the last stage of the development of the political conception of arete: first came courage, then prudence and justice, and now finally wisdom - the virtues which Plato retained as the essence of the citizens highest arete. 

The speculations of the early physiscists were not guided by logic, but by other kinds of spiritual activity - by imagination led and controlled by reason, the characteristically Greek sense of structure and architectonic form through which they analysed and ordered the visible universe, and a strange symbolist belief that the non-human world could be interpreted through human life. 

Parmenides: Thinking is the same as being, separate from the sensory world of coming-to-be and passing-away which leads us to "scary" conclusions. Although his discovery was troubled and distorted by many problems, it brought into action one of the fundamental forces of the Greek genius for educating humanity and comprehending the universe. Every line he wrote pulsates with his ardent faith in the newly discovered powers of pure reason. Parmenides was a natural poet, because he was carried away by his conviction that he must preach his discovery, the discovery which he believed to be in part at least a revelation of the truth. Parmenides' poem is charged with a proud humility. Although his presentation of the facts is uncompromisingly austere, still he feels that he is only the instrument and servant of a power far higher and more worthy than himself.

Heraclitus was the first philosopher to introduce the idea of phronesis and to put it on a level with sophia: that is, he connected knowledge of Being with insight into human values and conduct, and made the former include the latter. We must not imagine that this social universality of Heraclitus' logos is merely a metaphorical expression of the universal validity of logic. Community is the highest good known to the moral code of the city-state: it takes up and transforms the private existence of each individual. Thus, what at first seemed to be an exaggerated individualism in Heraclitus, his imperative and dictatorial attitude, is now revealed as the very opposite of individualism; for it is a deliberate destruction of the weak and erring individual caprice, in which the whole of life was almost lost. Men must follow the logos. There is a law in the universe, as in the city. This uniquely Greek idea appears here for the first time in history. 

Conflict is the father of everything, only through conflict can dike establish herself. Here he uses Anaximander's insight to give a visual interpretation to the new Pythagorean conception of harmony. That which opposes, fits; different elements make the finest harmony. That is a law which obviously rules the whole cosmos. Throughout nature there are abundance and lack—the causes of war. She is full of sharp opposites: day and night, summer and winter, heat and cold, war and peace, life and death succeed each other in eternal interchange. All the conflicting opposites of cosmic life constantly replace one another and are again replaced. It rests by changing. Heraclitus' philosophy of humanity might by figured as the innermost of three concentric circles: the outermost his theology, the next his cosmology, and within them both his anthropology. In reality all of his circles are inseparable; at least his anthropology cannot be dissociated from his cosmological and theological teaching. 

## The Aristocracy: Conflict and Transformation 

The two leaders of the reaction towards the end of the sixth century, Pindar the Theban and Theognis the Megarian, were both filled with whole-hearted admiration for the aristocracy to which they themselves belonged. Their work was addressed to the nobles, who had nothing but repulsion and distrust for the social revolution inspired by Ionian ideas. Yet these nobles did not live in a world which was a peaceful survival from the past, but in one which was incessantly invaded by the new age, and forced to defend itself with passionate energy. They are inspired by the class-consciousness of the nobility, with its proud assurance of its own merits: they embody the aristocratic ideal of culture, as it was towards the end of the sixth century. Thus carefully and authoritatively stated by Pindar and Theognis, the aristocratic ideal of Greece proper was infinitely superior in educational weight and completeness to the Ionian ideal, with its various self-contradictory attempts to glorify natural life and individual personality. We owe it to the poets alone that we have any conception of the life and social condition of the Greek nobility in the sixth and fifth centuries. We may deal with Theognis first: because he was probably the elder of the two poets, and because he illustrates the dangerous social situation of the aristocracy during this period, whereas Pindar rather expresses its religious beliefs and its ideal of human character.

The Theognidean pieces express a violent hatred for the demos, the commons, and we can best imagine them as sung by the aristocratic political clubs at Athens in Critias' time— in the circle which produced the Old Oligarch's pamphlet on the constitution of Athens, and to which Plato him- self was closely allied by birth. Cyrnus, the young man to whom the poems are addressed, was bound to Theognis by Eros. The poet obviously considers that bond to be the basis of his educational relationship to him; and it was meant to make the man and the boy a typical couple, in the eyes of the class to which they both belonged. It is very significant that the first time we have an opportunity of studying the Dorian aristocracy closely we should find that homosexual love is a ruling motive in their character. But we must point out the position and the basis of homosexual love in the spiritual life of the Greek people. It must be recognized that the love of a man for a youth or a boy was an essential part of the aristocratic society of early Greece, and was inextricably bound up with its moral and social ideals. The Athenian poets and legislators who accept or praise it were chiefly aristocrats, from Solon to Plato. And the aristocrats throughout Greece were strongly influenced by the Dorian nobles. It is, after all, easy to understand how a passionate admiration of noble bodies and balanced souls could spring up in a race which for countless years had prized physical prowess and spiritual harmony as the highest good attainable by a man, and which had striven by grave and ceaseless rivalry, by exertion involving the utmost energies of mind and body alike, to bring these qualities to the greatest possible perfection. Men who loved the possessors of these enviable qualities were moved by an ideal, the love for areté. Lovers who were bound by the male Eros were guarded by a deeper sense of honour from committing any base action, and were driven by a nobler impulse in attempting any honourable deed. The Spartan state deliberately made Eros a factor, and an important factor, in its agoge. And the relation of the lover to his beloved had a sort of educational authority similar to that of the parent to the child; in fact, it was in many respects superior to parental authority at the age when youths began to ripen into manhood and to cast off the bonds of domestic authority and family tradition.

From Solon's poetry we have seen how the aristocracy had to fight for its position either against the threat of tyranny or against the growing power of the common people. By Solon the nobles are presented as a narrow and exclusive party, whose political supremacy meant wasteful mis-government and caused the suppressed masses to thrust huge and dangerous demands upon the state. The danger thus created had prompted Solon to construct his system of political morality, with its attempt to uphold the mean between the extremes and to guard the state from tyranny. The poems of Theognis too assume that the class-war is in full fury, he blames the opponents of the aristocracy alone for the unrest and injustice in his city. 

'The city is still the same, but its people have changed. Men who never knew anything of justice and the law, but wore away goatskins on their ribs and laired outside the city like wild deer—these men are now the nobles, Cyrnus, and those who once were noble are now poor wretches. It is an unbearable sight! And they laugh at one another and deceive one another and know no steady standard to tell them what is noble and ignoble, because they have no tradition. Make none of these citizens your true friend, Cyrnus, for any purpose whatever. Speak to them all in friendly words, but do not associate with them in any serious purpose; for you will learn the character of these miserable fellows, and see that they cannot be trusted in anything. Treachery, deceit, and wiles are what these hopeless creatures love.'

'Mix with the nobles, do not associate with bad men', by picturing the degradation of those bad men in the darkest colours. His whole teaching exemplifies what he means by mixing with the nobles, for he himself puts on the authority of true nobility to teach his young fellow noblemen the truth. His advice is to have few friends-men who do not say this to your face and that behind your back, and men on whom you can count in time of trouble. Every revolution produces a violent disturbance of credit and confidence; and men who hold the same political faith are drawn closer to one another, for treachery is spread far and wide. Theognis himself says that a trustworthy man is worth much gold at times of political discord. Is this still the old aristocratic code? That code had indeed idealized the friendship of Theseus and Pirithous, and of Achilles and Patroclus: and the reverence for a great example such as these is a very old element in aristocratic education. But now, when the aristocracy has been attacked and has fallen, the old doctrine of the value of good examples and noble friendships is transformed into a party-principle: the friendship of the ancient heroes is now a model for the friendship of members of the same political hetairia." It is impossible to avoid this conclusion from the fact that Theognis begins his teaching by insisting upon the correct choice of friendsand on the necessity of well-tested loyalty as the first condition of friendship.

This general distortion of the code resulted from the weakness of the nobility; and yet there was much true moral worth in the demand for loyalty (although it was political loyalty to one class which was meant) and for unconditional honesty as the precondition of friendship. That demand is the ultimate expression of political esprit de corps, the spirit which haughtily condemns its enemies thus:" 'the new people laugh when they betray one another'. The nobleman, shall be noble in conduct as well as in birth. Theognis believed that the identification of nobility with noble character was the strength of his class, and its last defence in the struggle for existence. A nobleman is a citadel and a tower for the emptyheaded commoners although he gets little honour for it. 

Certainly by the time of Theognis the nobility was, at least in part, reduced to poverty, and a new class of rich plebeians was rising to political power and social influence. This economic change was a serious blow to the old aristocratic conception of arete, which had always included the possession of social prestige and the external goods of life, for without them many specific qualities of the nobleman, such as liberality and magnanimity, could not be put into action. Solon's first thought - that God's power is seen in the fact that wealth won by injustice does not prosper in the long run - stirs Theognis to comparatively subjective reflections. 

Theognis holds that arete is the quality which characterizes the true nobleman when the presence or absence of wealth is left out of account; namely the very rare quality of spiritual nobility. 'In justice all virtue is summed up and every just man is a nobleman.' No doubt this view limits the scope of the supreme ideal of justice and makes it the virtue of one party, not a virtue which can be possessed by the whole state. But Theognis would not be repelled by that limitation. Pindar too held that justice was an essential and inseparable element of aristocratic culture, and in fact its full flower. That belief marked the conquest of the old aristocratic ideal by the new spirit of the city state. 

(Note-to-self: Melian dialogue; the eagle and the nightingale)

There was still one barrier to the complete assimilation of that spirit by the nobility-their unshakable belief in the virtues of noble blood. Theognis afirms that their highest duty is to preserve their purity of descent, and bitterly attacks the foolish and disloyal nobles who attempt to prop their fallen fortunes by marrying the daughters of rich commoners, or giving their daughters to the sons of parvenus. 'We select rams and asses and horses which are noble, and try to breed them from good stock: but a nobleman does not hesitate to marry a baseborn woman; wealth confuses breed.' The essentially aristocratic idea that a race must be preserved by inbreeding and special training was worked out in Sparta above all, and also by the great educational theorists of the fourth century. 

When we turn from Theognis to Pindar, we leave the fierce struggles of the nobility in Megara and elsewhere to defend its place in society, and mount to the summit of the calm, proud, inviolate life of early Greek aristocracy. At this height we can forget the problems and conflicts of Theognis' world, and eb content to marvel at the power and beauty of that noble and distant ideal. Pindar shows us the Hellenic ideal of an aristocracy of race in the hour of its noblest transfiguration, when, after centuries of glory extending from the mythical past to the hard modernity of the fifth century, the nobility could still draw thegaze of all Greece upon its exploits at the games of Olympia and Pytho, Nemea and the Corinthian Isthmus, and could still transcend all regional or racial dissidences in the universal admiration of its triumphs. It is this aspect of Greek aristocracy that we must study if we are to see that the part it played in the shaping of the Greek character was more than the jealous preservation of inherited class-privilege and class-prejudice, and the cultivation of a relentlessly intensified code of ethics based on property. It was the true creator of the lofty ideal of humanity which is manifest to this day-though more often admired than understood—in the Greek sculptures of the archaic and classical periods. The athlete whom these works portray in the harmonious strength and nobility of this utmost perfection lives, feels, and speaks for us again in Pindar's poetry, and through his spiritual energy and religious gravity still affects us with the strange power which is given only to the unique and irrecoverable achievements of the human spirit. For it was a uniquely precious moment when the God-intoxicated but human world of Greece saw the height of divinity in the human body and soul raised to a perfection high above earthly powers, and when in those gods in human shape the effort of man to copy that divine model through which artists had realized the law of perfection, unattainable but imperious, found its purpose and its happiness.

To pass from the 'older' civilization of Ionia to Pindar is like leaving the direct line of development which runs from the Homeric poems to the personal lyrics and the natural philosophy of the Ionians, and entering a different world. For although Pindar's faith in the mission of the nobility has much in common with Homer, Homer takes it lightly, almost gaily, while the younger poet speaks in deadly earnest. This is partly brought about by the difference of purpose between epic and the Pindaric hymn: the latter gives a solemn religious injunction, while the former relates and adorns. Still, the grave severity of Pindar is not simply dictated by the form and external purpose of his poems: it springs from his deeply felt kinship with and reverence for the aristocracy of which he writes. It is because his own nature is essentially aristocratic by birth and nurture that he can give the aristocratic ideal the compelling force which we call Pindaric. 

For the religious meaning of the athletic contest was embodied in all his songs for the victors at the four great games; and the religious life of the nobility reached a culminating point in the incomparable energy and ambition of the contest. Naturally, competetive athetics was originally an aristocratic exercise: this is confirmed by poetry, and was an essential precondition of Pindar's view of it. Although in his time the gymnastic contests had long ceased to be the preserve of the nobility alone, the old families still took a leading part in them. They had enough wealth and leisure to allow them to engage in prolonged training. The ideal unity of physical and spiritual which we still admire in the masterpieces of Greek sculpture, indicates how we must understand the athletic ideal of manly prowess, even if that ideal may have been very far from reality. The work of the great sculptors is enough to show how poor of an interpreter Xenophanes was of the loftly ideal which the religious art of that time strove to embody in shapes worthy of the Gods. Pindar's hymns were written to celebrate the greatest moment in the athlete's life, his victory at one of the great games. Victory was the precondition of the poem, for it was usually sung by a chorus of the victor's young fellow-citizens at or shortly after his triumphant return. In Pindar, the close connection between the hymn of victory and its external occasion had a religious significance comparable to the connexion between worship and art in the hymns to the gods. Pindar was the first to make the triumphal hymn a sort of religious poem, Inspired by the old aristocratic conception of the athletic contest, he gave a definite moral and religious significance to the spectacle of men struggling to bring their manhood to perfection in victory; and thereby he created a new type of lyric, which rose from a far greater depth of emotion and experience, and which seemed to look down from a sunny and triumphant peak upon the mysteries and struggles of man's destiny. So he restored to poetry the heroic spirit which was its earliest inspiration: he made it more than a simple record of events or a decorative expression of personal emotion, for he made it once more into praise of the prowess which is a pattern for posterity. Yet the fact that his poems were each dictated by a purely external, apparently casual occasion was his greatest strength: for it was victory which always demanded the song. The foundation of his poetry was this concentration upon a permanent standard. Again and again, in different phases he recurs to that thought, whenever he 'takes the Dorian lyre from its peg' and strikes the strings. 'One thing thirsts for another, but victory loves song best, song the readiest companion of crowns and virtues.' He declares that it is 'the flower of justice' to praise noblemen; in fact he frequently calls song 'the debt' which the poet owes the victor. Areta - we must write the word in the severe Doric form which Pindar himself uses — areta triumphant in victory will not be 'silently hidden in the ground', but demands to be made eternal in the song of the poet. At Pindar's magical touch everything in this dull ordinary world at once regains the fresh vigour of creation's morning. 'The word,' he says in his song for the Aeginetan boy Timasarchus, 'lives longer than deeds, when with success given by the Graces the tongue draws it from the depths of the heart.' There could be no greater contrast to the free expression of personal feeling in Ionian and Aeolic poetry from Archilochus to Sappho than Pindar's subordination of his poetry to a religious and social ideal, and his complete, almost priestly self-dedication to the service of the last survival of ancient chivalry.

If we start with what we have seen to be the unbreakable connexion between the victory and the song, we can see that there were several different ways in which Pindar's poetic imagination might approach and master its subject. It could, for instance, describe the physical details of the boxing-match or the chariot-race-evoking the excitement of the spectators, the clouds of dust, the clatter of wheels, as Sophocles does in Electra by the messenger's dramatic description of the chariot-race at Delphi. Pindar, however, seems to have paid little attention to that aspect of the contest: he describes it only in formal allusive phrases and gives it only minor emphasis. He thinks far more of the spiritual difficulty of the games than of their physical appearance, for his gaze is fixed upon the victor. He believes that victory is the manifestation of the highest human areta, and it is that belief which dictates the form of his poems. We cannot apprehend their form unless we understand his belief: for although a Greek artist was severely limited by the traditional form in which he chose to work, ultimately he chose and developed that form in accordance with the highest convictions of his soul. In Pindar's time sculptors carved only images of the gods or statues of athletic victors. But the resemblance goes deeper. Statues of that period show the same attitude as Pindar's poetry to the victor whom they depict: they do not record his personal features, but the ideal male body trained for the contest. Pindar could find no more suitable comparison, for he too does not write of the victor as an individual but as the representative of the highest areta.

Since Pindar conceives of areta as an aristocratic quality, he believes it to be bound up with the great deeds of the heroes of the past. He always sees the victor as the worthy heir to the proud traditions of his family, and honours the great ancestors who have bequeathed some of their glory to him. Yet he does not depreciate the achievement of the victor of to-day. Areta is divine because a god or demigod was the first ancestor of a family which possesses it: the power descends from him, and is constantly renewed in each succeeding generation. Thus Pindar cannot consider a victory purely as an individual, since his victory was won through his divine blood. Accordingly, almost all his praise of a heroes deeds passes over into praise of the heroes descent. Praise of the victor's ancestor's is a regular element in hymns of victory: through it, the victor joins the divine company of gods and heroes. Action is confined to the great, for only they can act and suffer. 

A family derives not only its fortune but even its areta from the gods. If the praise of areta is principally the work of the poet, then he is an educator in the highest sense. Pindar accepted this mission with a deep religious comprehension of his duty and his powers: and therein he differed from the impersonal Homeric bards. His heroes were men who lived and struggled in the immediate present, but he set them in the world of the myth. That is, he set them in the world of ideal heroes, whose heroism became a pattern for posterity to follow; invested by the brilliance of that world, they were to be kindled by its glory to exert their highest powers and thereby to reach the same pinnacle of achievement. This purpose gives Pindar's use of myths its peculiar value. He considered blame—which the Archilochus had used in his poems-to be ignoble.

The sentence 'become what you are' seems to sum up his whole educational message, the ideal pattern reaches its greatest sublimity. That is the meaning of all the traditional models which he holds-up to mankind: men must see in them their own true selves, raised to a higher plane. Once more we see the deep social and spiritual kinship of this aristocratic ideal of paideia with the educational spirit of Plato's philosophy of ideas. That philosophy is rooted in the aristocratic system of education, and is fundamentally alien to all the Ionian natural philosophies with which historians of philosophy almost invariably connect it.

Pindar lives and works in a world in which the myth is more real than any reality; and whether he is glorifying the old nobility or parvenu tyrants and fatherless bourgeois, he raises them all to the same pinnacle of half-divine glory by the magical touch of his deeper knowledge, his realization of the higher meaning of their life and their struggle. 

In Chiron, the wise centaur who teaches the young heroes, Pindar finds the mythical pattern for his own educational mission. When men believe that areta lies in the blood of a noble family, can they also believe that education is possible? Pindar recurs to this question several times. It had been posed, in essence, as early as Homer, for in the ninth book of the Iliad Achilles is confronted at the crisis by his teacher Phoenix; and Phoenix's admonitory speech falls unheard on the hardened heart of Achilles. There, however, the problem is whether inborn character will respond to guidance. Pindar is concerned with the modern question, whether the true virtue of man can be learnt, or only inherited by blood. 'Through inborn glory a man is very mighty; but he who learns from teaching is a twilight man, wavering in spirit, never stepping forth on firm foot, but lipping a myriad virtues with imperfect spirit.' Achilles astonished Chiron by showing his inborn heroism before he had been taught. So says the saga, and according to Pindar it knows all. Therefore the saga gave the right answer to the question. Education cannot act unless there is inborn areta for it to act upon, as there was in Chiron's glorious pupils, Achilles, Jason, and Asklepios, whom he 'fostered, strengthening their hearts in all seemly matters.'

Like the areta of the Olympic victor, the art of the poet cannot be learnt: and both flow from the same divine source. Wisdom exists only among the nobility; and so Pindar's poetry is in the deepest sense, esoteric. 'I bear beneath my arm many swift arrows within their quiver; they speak only to those who understand, and they always need interpreters. Wise is he who knows much by nature; but those who have but learnt, in the violence of their chattering, vainly croak like ravens against the divine bird of Zeus.' The 'interpreters' needed by his poems (the 'arrows') are the noble souls who have by nature the higher insight which poetry demands. The image of the eagle recurs elsewhere in Pindar. Here is the close of the third Nemean hymn: 'Swift is the eagle among birds, which darts down from afar and suddenly grips the bloody prey ni its claws; but the chattering daws feed low.' Pindar takes the eagle as a symbol of his consciousness of his poetic mission. It is not a mere decorative image. He feels that he is describing a metaphysical quality of the spirit, when he says that its essence is to live in the unapproachable heights, and to move freely through the kingdoms of the air, far above the lower sphere where the chattering daws seek their food.

Pindar himself, in those odes, passed far beyond the aristocratic convention, and spoke in his own voice with a clarity unparalleled elsewhere in his poetry. He felt that the education of kings was the last and highest task to which the aristocratic poet was called in the new age. Like Plato, he hoped to influence them for good, to induce them to realize in a changed world his own political dreams, and to show them how to repress the growing boldness of the mob. With that mission in mind, he stood in the brilliant court of Hieron of Syracuse, alonely apostle of 'truth' beside the greatest of those 'who had learnt'. It almost seems to be a spiritual law of nature, that no great historical type of society has the strength to formulate its own ideal with deep and sure knowledge until the moment when its life is over.

## The Cultural Policy of the Tyrants 

When Solon demanded justice for the oppressed workers of Attica, he never envisaged anything like the democracy which later claimed him as its founder. He merely wished the old aristocratic state to justify itself morally and economically, and at first he had no thought of its impending downfall. We know nothing of the history of the succeeding decades; but Aristotle saw from the archon-lists that the government of Athens must have been seriously disturbed on several occasions. Tyranny is of the utmost importance, both as a historical phenomenon, and as a motive force behind the far-reaching cultural revolution which begins in the sixth century with the fall of the aristocracy and the political rise of the bourgeoisie. The landowning nobility, which had until then held the supreme power in every state, found its position terribly shaken by the spread of money as a means of exchange to replace the old system of barter in kind. The nouveaux riches who joined the side of the landowning nobility were not welcomed — the nobleman has never been sympathetic to the millionaire merchant—and even the accession of strength which they brought was a doubtful gain.

As Burckhardt neatly says, in every Greek there was a hidden tyrant; to be a tyrant was such an obvious and generally accepted form of happiness that Archilochus could describe the contented carpenter no better than by saying that he did not covet a tyranny. The Greeks always felt that the rule of one supremely able man was, in Aristotle's words, 'according to nature', and they tended to acquiesce in it when it appeared. 

Although, then, the tyrant did not educate the citizens towards universal political areté, he became their model in another sense. Without the responsibility which attached to their position, he was the prototype of the statesmen of later centuries. He was the first to show that a nation could be governed on a far-sighted plan involving long-term calculations of means and ends. That is, he was the first to engage in real politics. In political life he was the characteristic expression of the newly awakened individualism of the seventh and sixth centuries, as the poet and the philosopher were, in different but related spheres. During the fourth century, when the general interest in great individuals incresed and produced the new literary form, biography, its favorite subjects were poets, philosophers and tyrants. And the seven wise men who became famous about the beginning of the sixth century included not only lawgivers and poets but tyrants like Periander and Pittacus. A particularly significant fact is that nearly all the poets of that period lived at the courts of tyrants. Individualism was not yet a general rule, and there was no universal levelling-down of the intellect: individualism still meant true spiritual independence. And for that very reason the few independent souls sought one another out for mutual support.

In Athens, we can estimate the full effect on the development of Attica, the effects produced by the tyrants' interest in art, poetry, and religion. Their courts fostered the beginnings of comic and tragic drama, and of Athenian music, which reached such a high development in the fifth century. It encouraged the great recitations of Homer, and incorporated them in the Panathenaea, the national festival which Pisistratus so splendidly reorganized. It planned the great festivals of Dionysus, and stimulated the practice of the fine arts, sculpture, architecture, and painting. It made Athens what she always remained — a city of the Muses. Their court was the source of the inexhaustible stream of poetry and art which flowed for centuries through the symposia of Athens. They were ambitious to win victories in the chariot-race at the great national games; and they supported every form of athletic competition. They provided, in fact, a powerful stimulus to the advance of general culture in the life of their time. Some have believed that the great development of religious festivals and the encouragement of all the arts, which are typical of the Greek tyrannies, were merely stratagems to distract the restless minds of the citizens from political questions and to give them a new but safe interest. Even if these motives did play some part in the cultural policy of the tyrant, his deliberate concentration on his task shows that the development of art and intellect was meant to be a real contribution to the life of the community: it was part of his service to the public.

Public interest in religion and the arts was of course not a new thing, but it was suddenly increased to a vast extent when they were systematically cultivated by a rich and powerful ruler. His official encouragement of cultural activity was a proof of the tyrant's affection for the common people. That duty was later taken over by the democratic state, which merely followed his example. After the work of the tyrants, no state could afford to exist without pursuing a systematic cultural policy. At that period, however, the state's interest in culture was confined to the adornment of religion by the arts and the support of artists by the tyrant. These activities never brought the state into conflict with itself. Dissensions within the state could be created only by poetry which invaded public life and ideas more deeply than the lyric poets at the tyrant's court ever ventured to do, or by science and philosophy, which did not then exist at Athens. We never hear that the early tyrants showed any favour to famous philosophers; they concentrated rather on increasing the scope and popularity of the arts, and on improving the aesthetic and physical standards of the people. The aristocracy had never done so; but the culture which it possessed could not be imparted in that way. And on that very fact was based the permanent importance of the aristocracy, even after its fall from power, in the culture of the nation.

The sense of privilege binds artist and patron together, even when they despise each other. Theognis and Pindar, being apostles of the aristocratic creed, were exceptions to that rule. They were therefore ahead of their age, and less akin to their other contemporaries than to Aeschylus, the Athenian of the age of the Persian wars. Aeschylus on the one hand, and Theognis and Pindar on the other, although working on different principles, represent the overthrow of the professional art which flourished under the tyrants.

## The Drama of Aeschylus

Pindar hoped that the aristocracy in all its splendour would be reborn in the old spirit of rigid loyalty to tradition. Aeschylus showed in his tragedies how the hero could be born in the new spirit of freedom. It seems a short and inevitable journey from Pindar to Plato, from the aristocracy of race to the aristocracy of spirit and intelligence; but the transition can be made only through Aeschylus. Once more, as in Solon's time, the good genius of the Athenian people produced, at the beginning of its career in world-history, a poet to form and strengthen its spirit for the new task. State and spirit now coalesced, and became a perfect unity: and that very rare unity gave the new type of man which appeared at this time its quality of classical uniqueness. 

The young democracy of Aeschylus' time is the perfect illustration of Montesquieu's words in L'esprit des lois that the ancient democracy in its true and original form was based on virtue. At last the state had become, in Solon's sense, the force which binds together all human endeavours. That faith in the ideal of justice by which the young state was inspired now seemed to be divinely consecrated and affirmed in the victory" over Persia. And now, for the first time, the true culture of the Athenian people came into being.

It was the next generation, the era of Sophocles, that found the ideal of classical harmony to balance the two extremes. That which neither aristocratic culture nor the influence of a highly developed alien civilization could give to Athens was produced by her own historical destiny. Through that destiny a great poet arose, deeply conscious that he was part of the Athenian nation, to implant in his fellow-citizens the eager and devout sense of victory, and to unite classes, separated by differences of birth and culture, in a common gratitude and aspiration.

Tragedy restored to Greek poetry its power of embracing all human interests. Therein it can be compared only with the Homeric epic. In spite of the rich fertility of literature in the intervening centuries, tragedy was equalled only by epic in its wealth of subject-matter, its power of handling large masses of material, and its sheer magnitude of creative. achievement. It seemed as if the poetic genius of Greece, once born in Ionia, had been reborn in Attica. Epic and tragedy are two huge mountain-chains, connected by an unbroken line of foothills. In the sixth century, poetry in mainland Greece had regained what it had lost in Ionia, its noble function as a guide and inspiration of life. Thus, in an age which seemed to be moving ever further away from heroism, and (as Ionian literature shows) exercised its greatest powers on reflective thinking and heightened emotional perception, there sprang from those roots a new and more deeply felt spirit of heroism, which was closely and fundamentally akin to the myth and to the way of life embodied in the myth. It poured new life into the old mythical forms, and gave them back their speech, as Odysseus gave life and speech to the dead—by letting them drink of the blood of sacrifice. Without that sacrifice, the miracle of the myth's resurrection could not be understood. In its finished form, which we find in Aeschylus, it is a rebirth of myth, brought about by the new conception of man and of the universe which had been given by Solon to the Athenian people, and which in Aeschylus reached the highest and most sensitive realization of the religious and moral problems which it had to face.

For tragedy was a many-sided thing, and can be approached from widely different points of view. We are attempting merely to examine it as a spiritual embodiment of the new type of human character which was growing up in the fifth century, and of the educational power which it possessed in a supreme degree. The undisputed supremacy of Attic tragedy, which lasted for a hundred years, coincided chronologically and spiritually with the rise, greatness, and decline of the secular power of Athens. The men of that age never felt that the nature and influence of tragedy were purely and simply aesthetic. Its power over them was so vast that they held it responsible for the spirit of the whole state; and although as historians we may believe that even the greatest poets were the representatives, not the creators, of national spirit, our belief cannot alter the fact that the Athenians held them to be their spiritual leaders, with a responsibility far greater and graver than the constitutional authority of successive political leaders. The tragic festival was the climax of the city's life. 

The definition of tragedy was worked out only after the greatest Greek tragedies had been written. And if we try to give an acceptable meaning to the question 'what is the tragic element in a tragedy?' we must answer it differently for each of the tragedians. A general definition would only confuse the issue. The shortest way to find a universally applicable answer is by tracing the history of the ideas expressed in tragedy. The Greeks of the sixth and fifth centuries had long been brooding on the great religious problem: why does God send suffering into the life of man? The force of this question was now intensified in the presentation of human suffering to the eyes and ears of the spectators at the tragic festivals by the emotional ardours which the chorus expressed through dance and song, and which through the entrance of several speakers developed into the presentation of a complete episode of human fate. As the spectators shared in the agony of the tragic characters and chorus beneath the thunderstrokes of fate (which Solon had compared to a tempest), they felt their highest spiritual energies called out to resist the storm, and were driven by pity and terror, the immediate psychological effects of their experience, to fall back on their last defence-their faith in the ultimate meaning of life itself. The specifically religious effect on the audience of sharing in the terrors of human destiny, which Aeschylus' tragedies succeeded in producing as an integral part of the action, is the essentially tragic element in his dramas. To appreciate them, we must abandon all modern conceptions of the essence of drama or the essence of tragedy, and direct our attention to that element alone.

When we say that the old myths were made to live again in tragedy, we mean that they were made actual not only to the senses, but to the minds of the spectators, and not only by the change from narrative description to dramatic action but by the renaissance of their characters and their spirit in the new medium. The traditional legends were now handled from a contemporary point of view. Aeschylus' successors, particularly Euripides, went so far in that direction that they finally vulgarized tragedy into a drama of everyday life; but the first step had been taken by Aeschylus himself in presenting traditional heroes (who were often known only by name and by the bare outlines of their deeds) in accordance with his own conception of them.

The tragic poet's hand is clearly shown in the constant introduction of God and fate into the play. The myths did not introduce them in this manner; but Aeschylus ranges every dramatic event under the supreme problem developed by Solon out of the thought of the later epic: how to justify the ways of God ot man. He is constantly striving to explore the hidden reasons for God's power over human life. But as man becomes increasingly conscious of his selfhood, he tends to consider his own will and reason independent of higher powers: and thereby he becomes more responsible for his own fate. As soon as men recognize this connection between crime and punishment, they take on themselves a great part of the responsibility for their own misery.

Some have wondered why the Greek poets did not write more tragedies on 'historical themes'. The reason is simple: most historical events did not satisfy the conditions of Greek tragedy. The Persians shows how little attention the tragic poet pays to the external dramatic reality of a situation. His entire interest is in the effect of destiny upon the soul. In this respect Aeschylus' attitude to history is the same as his attitude to the myth. But even the suffering of the tragic characters is introduced to serve a deeper purpose; and in that, The Persians is a model Aeschylean tragedy, though in the simplest form known to the poet. Suffering brings knowledge: that is a piece of very ancient folk-wisdom.

Aeschylus did not believe that destiny was simply a force which punishes the guilty man to make an example for others. So much is clear from the language of the macabre images in which he depicts the workings of até; for no poet before him had so vividly realized and expounded its daemonic nature. By Aeschylus' description, even the strongest believer in the moral power of knowledge is driven to see that até always remains até, whether, as Homer says, its foot moves over the heads of men, or in Heraclitus' phrase man's own character is his deamon. What we call character is not an essential element in Aeschylean tragedy. His whole conception of fate is summed up in the tension between two ideas - his faith in the perfect and uninterrupted justice of God's government of the world, and his horrified realization of the daemonic cruelty and perfidiousness of até, which leads man to violate the world-order and inevitably to be punished for his violation.

In the representative poetry of the new democracy the city-state appears as the guarantor of the freedom and the human dignity and security of the individual. The guilt of Orestes is not founded on his character. Aeschylus does not consider him to be a man whose nature destines him to commit matricide. None of Aeschylus' tragedies exposes the problem on which his poetry and thought were centred more clearly than the Oresteia. That problem is the conflict between the divine powers which, each in its own way, strive to uphold justice. 

The devout soul of Aeschylus realized through the power of suffering the splendor of God's triumph. None can truly know that suffering and that triumph until, like the eagle in the air, he joins fullheartedly in the cry of victory with which all living things salute Zeus the conqueror. That is the meaning of the accord set up by Zeus in Prometheus, the harmonia which mortal wishes never overstep, and to which even the Titan-made civilization of mankind must end by adapting itself. And from this point of view there is a deep significance in the fact that Aeschylus' life and his poetic achievement close, in the final scene of the Oresteia, with the picture of the cosmos, harmonious order throughout the state, reconciling all oppositions, and itself based upon the eternal cosmos. As it takes its place in this universal order, the new figure of 'the tragic man' created by the art of tragedy displays its hidden harmony with the whole of life, and, by reaching new heroic heights of endurance, agony, and strength, rises to a far loftier humanity. 

## Sophocles and the Tragic Character 

In any account of the educational power of Attic tragedy, Sophocles and Aeschylus must be named together. Sophocles consciously assumed the position of successor to Aeschylus, and his contemporaries, while venerating Aeschylus as the master and inspirer of the Attic theatre, readily gave Sophocles the place next to him. This idea of tradition an inheritance is deeply rooted in the Greek conception of poetry, for the Greeks did not focus their attention principally on individual poets, but on poetry itself as an independent and self-perpetuating form of art, which, when bequeathed by one poet to another, continued to be a complete and authoritative standard.

It was then inevitable (quite apart from the permanence of professional tradition in all art, and especially in Greek art) that the constant competition and comparison between tragedies as they were produced from year to year should create a continuous form of intellectual and social control over this new artistic type — a control which did not interfere with artistic freedom, but made public taste extraordinarily sensitive to any falling off in the great tradition and to any diminution in the power and depth of the influence which tragedy exercised. 

Sophocles stands midway between his predecessor and his successor: he surrounds himself effortlessly with the men and women he has made. Or rather, they surround him. For true characters are never created by mere caprice. They must be begotten upon life by necessity: neither by the empty universal type nor the uniquely detailed individual, but by essential law, which is opposed to the inessential accident.

The tragedies of Sophocles and the sculptures of Phidias are the two imperishable monuments of the great age of the Athenian spirit. Together, they represent the art of the Periclean era. Looking backward from the work of Sophocles, one seems to see all the previous development of tragedy as merely leading up to this perfection. Even Aeschylus appears to be only a preparation for Sophocles; but Sophocles cannot be said to prepare the way for Euripides or the tragic epigonoi of the fourth century. Later poets are merely echoes of the greatness of the fifth century, and the true strength and promise of Euripides are most manifest when he leaves poetry and invades the new domain of philosophy. Therefore Sophocles is classical, inasmuch as he is the climax of the development of tragedy: in him tragedy 'had its nature', as Aristotle would say. But there is another unique sense in which he is classical: and here that description connotes more than perfection within one literary form. His position in the development of the spirit of Greece makes him classical— and here we are concerned with literature chiefly as the expression of that spirit and its transformations.

Sophoclean tragedy could almost be called a purely cultural art and be compared (though in far less artificial conditions of time and outlook) to Tasso with its unique position in Goethe's effort ot discover form in life and art, were it not that the word culture has so many different associations that it inevitably tends to grow vague and colourless. We must carefully avoid certain contrasts which have become clichés of literary criticism (such as that between original experience' and 'cultural experience') if we are to understand the true Greek meaning of culture. Culture was for the Greeks the original creation and original experience of a process of deliberate guidance and formation of human character.

The unity of the Athenian nation and the Athenian state, overarched, as it were, by the spiritual cosmos of Aeschylean tragedy, and won with such toil in the Persian wars, prepared the ground for a new national culture transcending all enmities and contrasts between the aristocratic civilization and the life of the common people. Even if we knew nothing else of Periclean Athens, we could tell from the life and character of Sophocles that in his time men were for the first time engaged in deliberately forming human character in accordance with a cultural ideal. That ideal was inspired by a clear and delicate perception of correct and appropriate behaviour in every situation, which, despite its precise rules for speech and conduct and its perfect sense of proportion and control, was in effect a new spiritual freedom.

It would be trivial and unworthy to interpret this way of life as purely aesthetic, a complex of elegant attitudes, or as purely psychological, a harmony of consonant spiritual powers, and thereby to mistake its symptoms for its essence. It was not only the accidents of personal character that made Sophocles the master of the rich central tones which Aeschylus could never sound successfully. In his work more than in that of any other poet, form is the immediate and appropriate expression, in fact the full revelation of being, and its metaphysical manifestation. To the question, 'What is the nature and meaning of this life?' Sophocles does not reply like Aeschylus with a theory of the universe, justifying the ways of God to man, but simply by the form of his speech and the characters of his men and women. This can hardly be understood by those who have never turned to Sophocles for guidance at moments when, in the chaos and unrest of life, all principle and al structure seem to dissolve away, and have never restored the balance of their own lives by contemplating the firm harmonious repose of his poetry. The effect of its sounds and rhythms is always one of balance and proportion; and balance and proportion are for him the principle of all existence, for they mean the reverent recognition of that justice which is implicit in everything and which can be realized only at the fulness of spiritual maturity. It is not for nothing that his choruses again and again describe disproportion as the root of all evil. The pre-established harmony of Sophocles' poetry and Phidias' sculpture is ultimately based on the quasi-religious acceptance of this law of harmony. In fact, the universal recognition of the law in fifth century Greece is such a natural expression of the characteristically Greek quality of sophrosyné — a quality whose metaphysical basis was the Greek view of the meaning of al life — that when Sophocles himself glorifies harmony and proportion, we seem to hear a manifold echo of his words in every region of the Hellenic world. It was not a new idea; but the historical influence and the absolute significance of an idea do not depend on its novelty, but on the depth and power with which men understand it and live it. Sophocles' tragedies are the climax of the development of the Greek idea that proportion is one of the highest values in human life. This process leads up to him, and in him it finds its classical poetic expression as the divine power which rules the world and human life. 

Two remarks made by Sophocles harmonize with our intuitive judgement of his art: Sophocles described his own characters as ideal figures in contrast to Euripidean realism. In the other he distinguished his own work from that of Aeschylus by saying that Aeschylus wrote correctly without knowing why: he denied him that deliberate intention to be right which seems an essential element in his own work. Both remarks taken together presuppose a very special awareness of standards to be followed: Sophocles guided his work by a standard and in it presented men 'as they ought to be'. Now, such awareness of the ideal standards of character is peculiar to the period when the sophistic movement was beginning. The problem of the nature of human areté is now taken up with terrific intensity from the educational side. Al the discussions of that age, and all the efforts of the sophists, were directed towards finding and producing man 'as he ought to be'. Until then, poetry alone had given reasons for the values in which men believed; but it could not remain unaffected by the new educational movement. Aeschylus and Solon had given their work far-reaching influence by making it reflect the struggles of their own souls to apprehend God and Fate. Now Sophocles, following the cultural trend of his age, turned to Man, and expressed his own moral standards in the characters he drew. It is impossible, and for Sophocles needless, to decide whether the cultural ideal or the poetic creation came first. What is essential is that in his time poets and educators had the same great purpose in view.

The sense of beauty that produced the men and women of Sophocles arose from a vast new interest in the souls of tragic characters. It was a manifestation of the new ideal of areté, which for the first time emphasized the central importance of the psyché, the 'soul', in all culture. In the course of the fifth century the word psyché acquired a new overtone, a loftier significance, which reached its fulness in the teaching of Socrates. The soul was now objectively recognized as the centre of man's life. Long before, sculptors had discovered the laws that shape and govern the body and had studied them with the greatest enthusiasm. In the 'harmony' of the body they had rediscovered the principle of cosmos apprehended by philosophers in the structure of the universe. Only in classical Greece could the concept of cuiture have been inspired by the sculptor's art. Educators and poets were inspired by the sculptor's effort to create an ideal figure, and took the same path towards the idea of humanity; while the sculptor or painter was led by the example of education and poetry to look for the soul in every model he used. The focus of interest for all three was the higher value which now attached to humanity. The Athenian mind has now become anthropocentric; humanism has been born —not the emotion of love for all other members of society, called philanthropia by the Greeks, but intellectual search for and interest in the true nature of man. 

We can now understand the changes which tragedy underwent when Sophocles took it over from Aeschylus. The most obvious external change is Sophocles' abandonment of the trilogy, which had been Aeschylus' regular dramatic form. It was now replaced by single dramas, centred on one principal actor. It was impossible for Aeschylus togive dramatic treatment to the connected development of one destiny on the epic scale, often covering the sufferings of several generations of the same family, in anything less than a trilogy of tragedies. His chief concern was the unbroken course of the fate of a family, because it alone formed a whole large enough to demonstrate the working-out of divine justice, which even religious faith and moralsentiment can hardly trace in the doom of one individual. But in Sophocles the ideal of justifying God's ways to man which dominates religious thought from Solon to Theognis and Aeschylus falls into the background. The tragic element in his plays is the inevitability of suffering: the necessity of destiny, seen from the point of view of the individual sufferer. He has not, therefore, abandoned Aeschylus' religious view of the nature of the world, but has merely shifted the emphasis from universal to individual problems. With great penetration Hegel saw that Antigone dealt with the tragic conflict of two moral principles: the law of the state, and the rights of the family. There is always an immediately intelligible reason for the sufferings of a Sophoclean hero: he is not condemned to suffer, as if by some supernatural judge, he is through his own noble nature a visible example of the inevitability of the doom into which the gods lead men. The irrationality of até had puzzled Solon and exercised the minds of all the serious thinkers of that age, but for Sophocles it is the basis, not the central problem, of tragedy. Aeschylus had tried to solve the problem of até: Sophocles admits its insolubility as a fact. By making his tragic characters greatest and noblest of mankind, Sophocles cries Yes to the fateful question which no mortal mind can solve. His characters are the first who, by suffering by the absolute abandonment of their earthly happiness or of their social and physical life, reach the truest greatness attainable by man.

Sophoclean drama is the drama of the emotions through which the soul of the chief actor must pass, following in its own rhythm the harmonious development of the plot. The source of his dramatic effect is the hero's character, to which, as to the highest and final point of interest, it always returns. Dramatic action is for Sophocles the process by which the true nature of a suffering human being is unfolded, by which he fulfils his destiny, and through it fulfils himself. To know oneself is thus for Sophocles to know man's powerlessness; but it is also to know the indestructible and conquering majesty of suffering humanity.

## The Sophists 

The age of Sophocles saw the beginnings of an intellectual movement which was to have immeasurable effects on the history of mankind. This was the movement of paideia, education, or rather culture, in the narrower sense. The word paideia, which at its first appearance "meant 'childrearing', and which in the fourth century, the Hellenistic, and the Imperial Roman ages constantly extended its connotation, was now for the first time connected with the highest areté possible to man: it was used to denote the sum total of all ideal perfections of mind and body-complete kalokagathia, a concept which was now consciously taken to include a genuine intelectual and spiritual culture. Everywhere in Greece, therefore, attention was now focussed on the principal question: What type of education leads to areté? Without that question, the unique Hellenic ideal of culture could never have arisen; but for all its fundamental clarity, it presupposes the varied development which we have traced from the oldest aristocratic conception of areté. 

In fact, the new bourgeois city-state was at a great disadvantage compared with the old aristocracy, in that — although it possessed a new ideal of manhood and citizenship and believed it far superior to the old — it had no regular method of deliberately educating the young to attain that ideal. A father would give his son technical training in the rules and skills of his vocation, if he followed him in his trade or profession; but such training could not replace the physical and spiritual education of the whole personality as practised by the aristocratic kalos chagathos and patterened on an ideal which combined the highest qualities of body and soul. 

Aristocratic education had been based on the inheritance of areté through noble blood: the new areté was necessarily based on the same kind of principle. The Athenian state, for example, made every free-born citizen of Athenian descent consider himself a member of the Attic community, and qualified him to serve it. Despite the new emphasis on individual personality, it would then have been unthinkable that education should be founded on anything but membership of the political community. In fact, that is the supreme axiom of al cultural education, and the greatest proof of its truth is the origin of Greek paideia. Its aim was to transcend the aristocratic principle of privileged education, which made it impossible for anyone to aquire arete unless he already possessed it by inheritance from his divine ancestors. Therefore the great educational movement, which distinguished the fifth and fourth centuries and which is the origin of the European idea of culture, necessarily started from and in the city-state of the fifth century. It aimed, as the Greeks understood it, entirely at political education, training to serve the polis. At any rate, unless the whole population had been given an active part in government (and that is the basis and one of the distinguishing marks of democracy), it would have been impossible for the Greeks to ask and answer the eternal questions which exercised them so deeply at that period of their history and which they left for posterity to answer in its own way. 

The educational movement starts from the culture of the old aristocracy, and then after moving away in a wide curve, as it were, returns in Plato, Isocrates, and Xenophon, to the original aristocratic traditions and the aristocratic ideal of arete, now re-established on a newly intellectualized basis. The urgency of the new problem of the connection between state and intellect, which was to bring the sophistic movement into being: the aristocracy of race had been displaced by the aristocracy of intellect, an new conflict immediately appeared in place of the old. This was the problem which ceaselessly exercised all philosophers until the city-state passed aay - that relation between a great intellectual personality and the community in which he lived. From its first appearance, the aim of the educational movement led by the sophists was not to educate the people, but to educate the leaders of the people. Presence of mind and sound foresight are inborn, but the talent for speaking convincingly and powerfully can be developed by training. In classical Greek the politician is simply called rhétor, an orator. The word had not yet acquired the purely formal meaning which it had in later times, but denoted the content of the orator's speeches too: it was obvious and natural at that time that every public speech would deal with the state and its interests. Eloquence, then, was the point from which any attempt to educate a man for political leadership was bound to start. Political education logically became rhetorical education - although the logos which was its object might contain very various proportions of formal and material instruction.

The sophists' attempt to teach political areté was a direct reflection of a deep-seated change in the structure of the state. Thucydides, with the insight of genius, saw and described the vast transformation which Athens underwent at its entry into the political arena of Greece. As it changed from the old static city-state to the dynamic imperial state of Pericles, all its energies were brought into violent action and competition, both ex: ternally and internally. In fact, what was common to the sophists was that they all taught political areté, and all wished to instil it by increasing the powers of the mind through training whatever they took the training to be. We can only stand amazed at the wealth of new and permanently valuable educational knowledge which the sophists gave to the world. They were the inventors of intellectual culture and of the art of education which aims at producing it. At the same time it is clear that whenever their new culture went beyond formal or factual education, whenever their political training attacked the deeper problems of morality and the state, it was in danger of teaching half-truths—unless it could be grounded on genuine and thorough political thought, searching for the truth for its own sake. Both the sophists and Socrates analysed everything, and thought nothing was so great or so sacred that it was beyond discussion and did not need to be founded on a rational basis.

However, it would be a fault perpsective to hold them akin to great thinkers like Anaximander and Heraclitus. Starting with the Milesians, the study of the whole cosmos gradually focused on the study of man, as the problems of human existence came more and more to be the centre of interest. Only Heraclitus was a great enough thinker to construct upon one single principle a theory of the cosmos under the government of law, which included man as an essential part of it. All these attempts to connect the two worlds, the world of man and the world of nature, are clear symptoms of the growing importance of the new philosophical problem of human character and human life. Still, they did not produce the educational theories of the sophists. The increasing concentration of philosophy upon the problem of man is another proof that the existence of the sophists was historically necessary; but they came into existence in response to a practical need, not a theoretical and philosophical one. At the same time, the fact that educational theory was now transferred from poetry to prose is a sign that it was at last thoroughly rationalized. Inheriting as they did the educational function of poetry, the sophists also turned their attention to discussing its nature and purpose.

The fact that it was possible for men to live in Greece at that period with such utter independence is the surest and most characteristic sign that an entirely new and fundamentally individualist type of culture was coming into being—for the sophists were individualists, however much they might talk of education to serve the community and training in the areté of a good citizen. All in all, they are a phenomenon of the first importance in the history of culture. Through them paideia-the ideal and theory of culture, consciously formed and pursued—came into being and was established on a rational basis. This conception of the nature of 'universal' culture summarizes the whole history of Greek education: ethics and politics taken together are one of the essential qualities of the true paideia. It was not till a later age that a new aesthetic ideal was superimposed on or substituted for the old conception of humanism, because the state had lost its predominant position in human life. But the close connection between higher education and the idea of society and the state is an essential feature of classical Greece.

Originally the concept paideia had applied only to the process of education. Now its significance grew to include the objective side, the content of paideia - just as our word culture or the Latin cultura, having once meant the process of education, came to mean the state of being educated; and then the content of education, and finally the whole intellectual and spiritual world revealed by education, into which any individual, according to his nationality or social position, is born. The historical process by which the world of culture is built up culminates when the ideal of culture is consciously formulated. It is easy to understand why Nietzsche and Bachofen felt that the summer of Greece was the time before ratio, conscious reason, appeared — the mythical period, the age of Homer or the great tragedians. But it is impossible to accept that romantically simple view of the early age of Greece, because the mind of a nation, like the mind of an individual, develops in accordance with an immanent and inevitable law, and its impression on posterity must necessarily be not single but complex.

In turn it was the sophists that had made all of Greece conscious of the education problem. The conclusion is always the same, though expressed in different ways - nature is the ground upon which all education must build. The process of completing that education is called learning, sometimes teaching, and practice which makes what has been learnt into a second nature. Another problem is the relation between nature and art, Plutarch has an illuminating discussion of this aspect of educational theory in his essay On the education of children. The striking comparison of education and agriculture seems to be so closely connected with the doctrine of the educational trinity that it must be part of the sophistic theory of education. It was used before Plutarch, and for that reason too it must go back to an early source. Translated into Latin, it entered European thought and helped to produce the new metaphor cultura animi: the culture of mankind is spiritual culture, as the cultivation of the earth is originally agriculture. The modern word of culture is a clear echo of the original metaphor. In later humanistic theory these ideas were revived and helped to create the great importance which civilized or 'cultured' nations have since attached to the ideal of intellectual culture. We have described the sophists as the first humanists, and the description agrees with the fact that they created the conception of culture, although they could not guess that their metaphor would one day grow far beyond the simple idea of education, and become the highest symbol of civilization. 

Just as, the Greeks, thinking of sculpture, had held the cultivation of the body to be the act of shaping it as the sculptor shapes his stone, so now Protagoras viewed education as the act of shaping the soul, and the means by which it was carried out as formative force. In reading the Attic orators of that period we really feel that the logos is a wrestler stripped for the ring. The taut suppleness of a well-constructed proof is like the sinewy body of a well-trained athlete. The Greeks called a lawsuit or trial an agon, for they always felt that it was a fight in legalized form between two rivals. In the Athenian state law was not only the 'king' (as Pindar put it in a verse often quoted at the time) but the school of citizenship. We do not think of it in that way now. Nor do we believe that the laws are the discoveries of great law - givers of the past: they are ephemeral things, as they were to become in Athens, and not even specialists can know them all. We can hardly imagine how, when Socrates was in prison facing death, and was offered a safe opportunity for escape to freedom, the laws could appear to him in the shape of living persons and advise him to remain true to them in the hour of trial, because they had educated and protected him throughout his life and were the foundation of his whole existence.

Together with grammar and dialectic, rhetoric became the basis of formal education throughout Europe. These three were called the Trivium in late antiquity, and blended with the Quadrivium to form the system of the seven free arts: thus formally organized into an educational system, they outlived all the beauty and brilliance of ancient culture and ancient art. The upper classes of French schools still bear the names of these 'disciplines', inherited from the schools attached to the mediaeval monasteries, and thereby symbolize the unbroken tradition of sophistic culture.

While the foreign policy of democratic Athens, under the guidance of great statesmen and the supreme command of Pericles, continued to win success after success, the aristocrats remained sincerely loyal; or else feigned loyalty and paid lip-service to the demos - soon becoming astonishingly expert. in this new art, which sometimes became grotesque and ridiculous hypocrisy. Pericles' conception of the state, as set forth by Thucydides in the funeral speech, culminates in the declaration that the state is the great educative force, and that the communal life of Athens is a complete and pattern fulfilment of the cultural mission of the state.

Education in Protagoras' sense, namely education in the spirit of the traditional ideal of justice, is attacked by Callicles with a passionate earnestness that brings home the full force of his transvaluation of all values. What the Athenian state and its citizens hold to be the highest justice is for him the depth of injustice. "We mould,' he cries, 'the best and strongest among us to our will, catching them young like lions, and we enchant and enslave them by telling them that everyone must have equal rights, and that that is the meaning of nobility and justice. But in my opinion if a man of truly strong nature comes, he shakes all that of and bursts through it and escapes, trampling down our letters and spells and incantations and al our unnatural laws, and he our slave rises up to be our master; and then shines forth the justice of nature!' From this point of view, law is an artificial bond, a convention agreed on by the organized weaklings to repress their natural masters, the strong, and make them do their will. The law of nature is directly opposed to the justice of men. 

In modernity the belief is held that politics and morals are two separate worlds. not necessarily ruled by the same code. This divided allegiance, sanctioned by custom for twenty centuries, is a necessity which modern philosophers try to convert into a virtue; but the Greeks had nothing like it. We always think of political morality as a sharp contrast to individual morality: in fact many of us would prefer to write of political morality in quotation marks. But the Greeks in the classical era—in fact, throughout the whole period of city-state civilization — thought that political morality and personal morality were practically identical: since the state was the sole source of all moral standards, and it was difficult to see what other moral code could exist apart from the code of the state, the law of the community in which the individual lived and had his being. A purely private moral code, without reference to the state, was inconceivable to the Greeks. We must forget our idea that each individual's acts are ruled by his conscience. The Greeks thought so too, but not till a later and essentially different period. In the fifth century there were only two possibilities: either the law of the state was the highest standard for human life and coincided with the divine government of the universe, in which case a man was a citizen, no more and no less; or else the standards of the state conflicted with those established by nature or God, so that man could not accept them, in which case he ceased to be a member of the political community, and the very foundations of his life dissolved, unless he could find some certainty in the eternal order of nature.

Gentlemen,' Hippias says, 'I consider you all kinsmen and friends and fellowcountry-men, not of course by law but by nature. For by nature like is akin to like. but law the tyrant of men forces many things through against nature.' The views of the sophists on man, the state, and the universe had none of the seriousness and deep metaphysical understanding which had enabled the preceding generation to build the Athenian state, and which the generation after them was to rediscover in philosophy. Yet it would be wrong to look for their real achievement in the field of philosophy and ethics. Their strength lay in the brilliant new system of formal education which they invented.

## Thucydides: Political Philosopher 

The oldest type of history was created in lonia during the beginnings of natural science: the word lotogly shows its lonian origin, and always connoted physical research too, which was originally its true meaning. As far as we know, Hecataeus (who came like the first great physicists from Miletus, the cultural capital of Ionia) was the first to transfer his 'investigation' from the whole of nature to one special field, the inhabited earth—which had hitherto been considered simply as a part of the cosmos, while the character and structure of its surface had been described only in general terms. 

The next step was Herodotus, he gave unity to the medley of rise and fall of men and the power of gods, as various and intricate as an antique tapestry, by basing it upon one great central theme: the conflict of East and West, from the first historically certain clash, the war between the Greeks and the neighbouring kingdom of Lydia under Croesus, to the Persian invasion of Greece. Herodotus' history of the nations would not in itself have prompted anyone to write a political history. But Athens, while concentrated earnestly and exclusively on the present, had suddenly reached a crisis in which serious political thinkers were compelled to develop a historical consciousness, although now in a new sense and with a different content. They were forced, in fact, to discover the historical necessity of the crisis to which the nation's development had led. This is the real nature of the intellectual revolution reflected in Thucydides' history - historical writing had not become political, but political thinking had become historical. It was the war that made Thucydides a historian.

It is extraordinarily instructive to see how Thucydides sets aside the whole of ancient historical tradition because it gives no answer to his questions, and replaces it with his own hypotheses, a set of bold inferences based on his own clear insight into the logical connexion between cultural, political, and economic development. The intellectual character of these inferences resembles that of the sophists' hypothetical reconstructions of the life of primitive man, but their point of view is different. Thucydides is looking at the past with the eyes of a fifth-century politician: he thinks only of power. Technical knowledge, economic development, and intellectual culture he tends to ignore, except as necessary conditions for the development of power. Power means for him first of all the possession of great capital resources and wide territory, supported by a strong navy.

By sketching the past in bold economic and political lines, he reveals his attitude to the events of his own time. In his description of the war, the same principles appear at much closer quarters and far less obviously, because they are applied on a much larger scale; but here they have almost the purity of abstraction. 

In peace, he says, states and individuals obey reason more easily because they are not subject to inevitable necessities: but war increases the difficulties of life and teaches the mass of men by force to adapt their character to their circumstances. In the course of the revolutions which war brought with it, faction - wars, plots, and reprisals constantly occurred, and the memory of previous revolutions and their terrors increased the violence of every new upheaval.

The collapse of society was only the outward and visible sign of the colapse of individual character. Even the hardships and trials of war affect a spiritually healthy nation very differently from a nation whose values are rotten with individualism.

What is it that gives the great Athenians (like Thucydides) such a pre-eminent place in the history of their nation that all the subordinate intellectual activity which we have described seems like the skirmishing of outposts before the decisive battle? It is this. Through these men, the rationalist spirit which already filled the air took possession of the greatest of all cultural forces - religion, morality, political theory, and poetry. Thucydides' history is a confession of faith by the now thoroughly rationalized state: it is its last intellectual achievement, at the moment of its downfall, and through it the state eternalizes its true and ideal nature.

According to Greek ideas, it was knowledge that moved men to act. So Thucydides' search for truth had a practical end in view, and thereby differed from the disinterested theoria, contemplation, practised by the Ionian scientists. No Athenian ever believed that knowledge could exist for any other purpose than to lead to right action.

'It will perhaps be found that the absence of mythology in my work makes it unattractive to listen to; but it wil suffice if it is judged useful by all who wish to study the plain truth of the events which have happened, and which will according to human nature recur in much the same way. It was written to be kept forever, rather than to be admired for a moment.' Several times he expresses the opinion that the history of individuals and nations repeats itself because human nature does not change. Though his work has the modern historical interest in separate events for their own sake, it tries to pass beyond them and to transcend what is strange and different so as to reach the universal and permanent law which they embody.

Thucydides' speeches' form a very important device, explicable not by a historian's passion for exactitude but by a politician's wish to penetrate to the ultimate political ground for every event. In the literal sense, that wish would be impossible to fulfil. In analyzing any situation, one could never keep to what people had actually said of it, for that would often be simply adisguise for reality; one would always be bound to disclose their thoughts, which is impossible. But Thucydides certainly believed that one could recognize the motives followed by each party, and record them; and therefore he determined to make men explain their deepest motives and beliefs in a public speech to the assembly, or between four walls as in the Melian dialogue, exactly as he judged each party was bound to speak in accordance with its political attitude. With their excessively difficult language striving to express equally difficult thoughts, contrasting strangely with a figurative style borrowed from sophistical rhetoricians, these speeches are the most direct expression of Thucydides' thought, which rivals the work of the greatest Greek philosophers both in obscurity and in profundity.

To write a speech in which Athens is praised by one enemy before another was a feat of the highest rhetorical skill. But also it had a double historical purpose: its immediate aim was to describe the agitation which led to the war, and its higher aim was to analyse the psychological basis of the rise of Athens.

The Spartans believed they were representing justice against selfishness and aggrandisement, but if they ever managed to destroy Athens and take over her power, the sympathy of Greece would soon swing away from them, and prove that power may change its owners, but not its political character, its methods, and its effect. Thucydides covers all the great political problems which arise during a war. The occasions he chooses for discussing them are selected with the greatest care, and are certainly not always suggested by the normal flow of events. He treats similar facts in very different ways-sometimes deliberately placing the cruelties and agonies of war in the foreground, and sometimes passing over even greater horrors with a dispassionate mention, because it is enough to illustrate that side of war by a few examples. In his actual narrative of the war, as in his account of its origins, the problem of the rise and maintenance of political power is central — in fact, most of the separate questions mentioned above are connected with it.

By making the Athenians justify the right of the stronger through the law of nature, and transform God from the guardian of justice into the pattern of all earthly authority and force, Thucydides gives the realistic policy of Athens the depth and validity of a philosophical doctrine. The Athenians are endeavouring to abolish the conflict between their policy and the forces of religion and morality - the forces which their weaker opponents hope to use to conquer them. In his highest intellectual achievements, such as the Melian dialogue, Thucydides remained a pupil of the sophists; " but by using their theoretical antinomies to describe historical fact he gave his description such tenseness and such conflict that it seems to embody all the aporiai of Plato.

It is the most dramatic moment in Thucydides' whole story — the moment in the Athenian assembly when Alcibiades, in face of all the warnings of the conservative and pacific Nicias, expounds his staggering plan for the conquest of Sicily and the mastery of all Greece, and explains that the expansion of a great empire like that of Athens cannot be rationed out; its possessors can maintain it only by extending it further, because every pause means the danger of collapsing. Thucydides means us to remember all that was said before the war, about the necessity of extending Athenian power without cessation, and about the restless, fearless, limitless optimism and enterprise of the Athenian character.

Similarly, in his character-sketch of Pericles, Thucydides emphasizes his influence on the people and his ability to lead it rather than be led by it. What made him superior to Alcibiades and all the rest was the additional fact that he was financially incorruptible, for that gave him the authority to tell the truth instead of saying what the public wanted to hear. He always kept the reins in his own hands: when the mob tried to kick over the traces he could frighten them and control them, and when they were discouraged he heartened them. Therefore, Athens under Pericles was nominally a democracy, but actually a monarchy under the foremost man: it was the monarchy of superior political ability. After the death of Pericles, Athens never had another such ruler. All his successors tried to imitate him, but none of them could acquire so much influence as he had, even temporarily, without flattering the mob and pandering to its passions. According to Thucydides, it was because there was no other man who could eliminate the influence of the people and its mob-instincts, surmount the democratic constitution, and govern like a king, that the Sicilian expedition failed quite apart from the fact that Pericles would never have undertaken it in the first place because it was directly opposed to his defensive strategy. 'I fear our own mistakes far more than the strategy of our enemies.' When Thucydides says that Pericles' sound foreign policy was based on his firm position in the internal government of Athens, he is thinking exclusively of the comparative insecurity of Alcibiades.

Thucydides carries this further, and makes the speech an idealized picture of the entire Athenian state. He could not allow anyone but Pericles to deliver it, for he was the only statesman who had the lofty intellect and character that made him worthy to expound the spirit of Athens. In the age of Thucydides, politics was fast becoming a specialty of careerists and climbers, thirsting for power and success. That is exactly what made Pericles superior to Cleon, and to Alcibiades too, in Thucydides' eyes — he had conceived an ideal of the state and of personal character, which gave all his work a real purpose. No translation can rival Thucydides' masterly ease in coping with his difficult task: abandoning al the trivialities of formal oratory, he describes the contemporary city-state, with the superb practical energy of its imperialist policy and the indescribable variety of its spiritual and vital force, so as to weld it all into one great unity. In Athens, says he, every man is alike before the law, but in politics the aristocracy of talent is supreme. 

Politeia means not only the constitution of the state but the entire life of the state as far as it is conditioned by the constitution. Even though the constitution of Athens was not like the Spartan discipline, which regulated every detail of the citizen's daily existence, the influence of the state was an all-pervading spirit which deeply affected the life of every Athenian. In modern Greek, politeuma means culture-perhaps the last vestige of the ancient conjunction of life and politics. Therefore, Pericles' description of the Athenian politeia covers the entire content of private and public life: economics, morals, culture and education. Only when we conceive it with such fullness and concreteness do we realize that Thucydides' ideal of the state is no mere power-machine, but something rich in colour, shape, reality. It springs from Pericles' own ideal of the Athenian politeia, and without that living content it would be imperfect. The power of which Thucydides speaks is never simply pleonexia, mechanical and spiritless greed. The remarkable composite character which marks all the expressions of the Athenian spirit-literary, artistic, philosophical and moral - reappears in Pericles' conception of the state: he deliberately praises a synthesis of the rigidly communal outlook of the Spartan armed camp, and the Ionian principle of the economic and intellectual freedom of each individual citizen. Thucydides does not conceive the newtype of state as a static thing, the rigid legal structure idolized in the early eunomia. But constitutionally and economically and spiritually he holds it to be a sort of Heraclitean harmony of radical and inevitable opposites, maintaining itself through tension and equilibrium. He therefore makes Pericles describe it as the interaction of delicately balanced opposites - selfsupport and enjoyment of the world's products, labour and recreation, business and holiday, spirit and ethos, thought and energy.

That was the ideal which the great leader of the Athenians expounded, with the full majesty of language, in order to make them at the critical juncture fully aware of the supreme values for which they were fighting, and to turn them into passionate "lovers' of their country. But Thucydides did not mean it to be valid for the Athenians alone. Spiritually as well as politically, he envisaged Athens as the centre of a historical sphere of influence. He saw it as exercising a vast intellectual stimulus, not only on itself but on the entire Greek world. 'To sum up, I call the whole city of Athens the school of Greek culture,' In this realization of the spiritual hegemony of Athens — a realization fully worthy of the greatest Greek historian — Thucydides' creative insight first recognized the fact that Attic culture was to have a far-reaching historical influence, and the problems which that fact involved. Thereby the Greek ideal of culture, which had attained a new breadth and sublimity in the age of Pericles, was charged with the utmost possible historical life and meaning. It became the complete expression of the noble influence which the Athenian people and the Athenian state exercised through their intellectual and spiritual life upon the rest of the world, and which led other nations to live and to create as they had done. The highest justification of the political ambitions of Athens, even after their defeat, was the ideal of paideia, through which the Athenian spirit found its greatest consolation — the assurance of its own immortality.
